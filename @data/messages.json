This lets users use their Copilot value on any document to which they have permission. Note that Copilot data protection is always based on the identity used to access the file. This ensures enterprise data protection for files in your organization, regardless of which account grants Copilot access. The setting for web grounding in Copilot is also based on the identity used to access the file. If you disabled web grounding in Copilot, users will not be able to use web grounding even when using Copilot access from another account.  This feature will be available starting in March 2025, at which point, users signed into accounts with external Copilot licenses will be able to use Copilot on their work and school documents in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote desktop and mobile apps.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b> \n</p><p>If you wish to restrict multiple account access to Copilot, you can use the “Multiple account access to Copilot for work documents” <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/admin-center/overview-cloud-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud Policy</a>.&nbsp; This policy setting is expected to be available in Cloud Policy by the end of January 2025</p><p><b>Additional information</b> \n</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2300619\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple account access to Copilot for work and school documents</a>.</p>",

If you wish to disable the preview, you can change the toggle to <i>Off</i> in the Message trace flyout. To use the new Message trace functionality through the PowerShell cmdlet Get-MessageTraceV2, please ensure you are using version 3.7.0 or later of the Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-December 2024 and expect to complete by late December 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><b>Key functionality changes</b>\n</p><ul><li>Extended query range: You can query up to 90 days of historical data for near real-time queries. However, please note that you can only query 10 days of data at a time. Please note that you will initially only have 30 days of historical data for near real-time query, and this will build over time to 90 days of historical data.\n</li><li>Subject filter: You can select a subject filter for Message trace queries, such as <i>Starts with, Ends with, </i>and <i>Contains</i> functions. This filter also supports special characters.\n</li><li>Delivery status filter: The delivery status filter will now support searches for <i>Quarantined, Filtered as spam, </i>and <i>Getting status</i> statuses.\n</li></ul><p><i>Additional updates</i>\n</p><ul><li>Customizable columns: For your search results, we’ve introduced customizable columns and added additional column options. <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/announcing-public-preview-of-the-new-message-trace-in-exchange-online/4356561\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the new columns</a>.\n</li><li>Persistent column widths: You will be able to customize your column widths, and these changes will persist in each logged-on admin account, so you will not have to reset column widths each time you run a new Message trace query. This update is still in progress and will be made available in early-February.\n</li><li>Wider flyout option: An option for a wider flyout for the Message trace detail will be available.\n</li><li>Time zone consistency: Message trace will default to the time zone set in the Exchange account settings of the logged-on admin.\n</li></ul><p><b>Key cmdlet changes in </b><code>Get-MessageTraceV2</code> (relative to <code>Get-MessageTrace</code>)\n</p><ul><li>Extended query range: You can query up to 90 days of historical data.

In addition, we are evolving the app's UI to support future AI-first experiences. Key changes include reducing the top app header, consolidating all app-level tools and settings into the App toolbar on the left, and retiring features like Help me create and My Day from the app.\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b>\n</p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app (web, Windows) starting in mid-January 2025. This is a phased rollout, so not all users will receive the update simultaneously.\n</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With these updates, users will notice the following changes:\n</p><ul><li>The app will no longer have a top header. Instead, tools like user profile, settings, and feedback will move to the bottom left toolbar. The feedback button will be available under the 'Settings and more' section in the bottom left toolbar.\n</li><li>The search box will now be presented on the Homepage for users to find all their content across multiple file types and storage locations. Note: There is no change to the search experience—only the placement of the feature.\n</li><li>All the apps on the left tool bar are aligned to the top and the AI rich experiences like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages will be presented together to establish correlation.\n</li><li>The organization logo, previously displayed in the top header under the Organization theme, will no longer be visible in the app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where the organization logo will still appear in the header.\n</li><li>The 'Back' button on the Windows Microsoft 365 Copilot app will not be available. Users will still be able to use the left AppBar to navigate between pages. \n</li><li>The 'My Day' feature is being removed from the app experience, and users will no longer see the button to launch the calendar and to-do on the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where My Day feature is available.\n</li><li>The 'Help me create' feature will be retired from the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Launched in February 2024, ‘Help me create’ was focused on helping users go from their stated intent to document creation using an LLM. With Microsoft 365 Copilot app becoming the destination for Copilot, we will be bringing AI powered document creation into Copilot tab. Users will be able to brainstorm ideas and draft new content based on a storyboard or a script to an agenda or an executive summary from Copilot Chat.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin or user action is required as these changes roll out. However, we recommend keeping your users informed about these updates to ensure they are aware that these changes are part of the app enhancements.</p>",

If you are currently following this guidance, <i>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.</i></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.&nbsp;</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain.&nbsp;</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.
