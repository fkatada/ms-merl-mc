Which is why we allow co-organizer to be added to the event so they can work alongside or on behalf of the organizer. So far co-organizers were able to set up event theming, manage registration, meeting options, view reports and more but were not able to edit event details like title, date/time, description, event group; nor publish or cancel event. Now they can! Co-organizer can edit event details, publish, and cancel the event like the organizer can. So once the co-organizer is added they will have full parity of experience as organizer and control/manage/edit event.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=168524\" target=\"_blank\">168524</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 (previously early January) and expect to complete by mid-January 2024 (previously mid-December).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 (previously mid-December) and expect to complete by mid-January 2025 (previously early January).<br></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>When co-organizer opens the event scheduling page, they should have the ability to edit the details page, publish, and cancel the event.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Nothing required to prepare.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 15, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through early March 2025 (previously January 1). You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

For tenants where the Anonymous users can join meetings option is disabled in meeting policy and admins would like to continue to block all unverified (anonymous) users joining meetings, admins should update the new meeting policy setting Anonymous users can join a meeting after verifying from “By e-mail code” to “No” by mid-February.  Without changing the default, this new feature introduces an additional way for unverified (anonymous) users to join meetings by e-mail code without needing an MSA or Entra account.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In mid-January, Microsoft Copilot will become available to users with an Entra account in Microsoft Teams and Outlook. If pinned, Entra users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app directly from the left rail in Outlook and Teams. On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header. Microsoft Copilot will also become available in the Store for users to add on their own, managed by the same admin settings used for app availability today. Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in February.</p><p>Note: During the rollout, the Microsoft Copilot app will temporarily be available for Semi-Annual Channel users of classic Outlook for Windows. These clients will respect admin and user preferences, but we typically do not show Copilot features in Semi-Annual Channel of classic Outlook for Windows. After customers update to Version 2408 or newer, the Microsoft Copilot app will once again be hidden for Semi-Annual Channel users.</p><p>In addition, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will have Copilot automatically pinned in the left rail in Teams, along with the Copilot chat that is automatically pinned in the Teams Chat pane for them today.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=420330\" target=\"_blank\">420330</a>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft Copilot app will be available to install and pin in Teams and Outlook starting mid-January 2025 (previously early January) and is expected to complete by late January 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft 365 Copilot app will be pinned by default in the Teams left rail staring mid-January 2025 and is expected to complete by late January 2025. </p><ul><li>On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header.&nbsp;</li><li>Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in mid-February 2025.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Starting mid-January, Microsoft Copilot admins and users will be able to pin the Copilot app in Teams and Outlook. Copilot will not be pinned by default for users without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.  If pinned, users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app in Teams and Outlook.\n</p><p>If your admins or users previously chose to pin Microsoft Copilot across the M365 app, Teams, and Outlook before pinning was released on Teams and Outlook, Microsoft Copilot will be retroactively pinned for them there.</p><p>Microsoft Copilot will also be added to the Store for users to add on their own. For licensed users, Microsoft 365 Copilot has already been installed, and users can open it from the Store.</p><p>Finally, in Teams, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will be able to access Copilot in the left rail as a pinned app by default, along with the Teams Chat pane where they can find it today. On Teams Mobile, users can access Copilot in the top header, and on Outlook Mobile in the tab bar.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Admins can control if Microsoft Copilot is pinned in Teams and Outlook using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/microsoft-365/pin-copilot\" target=\"_blank\">same Copilot pinning control shared previously to pin Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app.</a> Admins can also pin Microsoft Copilot in Teams by adding Copilot to Pinned apps in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies\" target=\"_blank\">app Setup policies</a> and assigning the policies to unlicensed users in Teams admin center.\n</p><p>With the pinning control, you have the option to pin or not pin Copilot for your users. If you select to not pin Copilot, you also have the option to allow your users to be notified to make this choice. If no action is taken, Copilot will not be pinned but users will be notified to pin it themselves.\n</p><p>Users can unpin Copilot in Outlook. Users can unpin Copilot in Teams if User pinning is enabled in app <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#pin-apps\" target=\"_blank\">Setup policies.</a>\n</p><p>Currently, you can remove access to Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app and copilot.cloud.microsoft as documented in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/manage#removing-access-to-microsoft-\" target=\"_blank\">Removing access to Microsoft Copilot</a>. These controls will continue to be respected as the Copilot app rolls out in Outlook and Teams. \n</p><p>In addition, you will be able to allow and block the Copilot app from appearing in Outlook, the Microsoft 365 app and copilot.cloud.microsoft through <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/teams-apps-work-on-outlook-and-m365?view=o365-worldwide#how-to-block-an-app\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 admin center (MAC)</a> like you would manage availability for any other app. These controls are already provided today for Microsoft Teams through <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/manage-apps#allow-or-block-apps\" target=\"_blank\">Teams admin center (TAC)</a>.</p>",

For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled. This retention policy won’t affect the copies saved in Exchange Online, to bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to this <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.</p><p>We will also update the default transcript permissions. After the rollout, when the new policy is not applied, only meeting organizers and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, and meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams or Microsoft Stream.

This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 10, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Please note that information about meeting link expiry changes related to this rollout has been added.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 (previously mid-February) and expect to complete by late April 2025 (previously late March). \n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out early June 2025 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late June 2025 (previously late April).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As communicated in MC816207 <i>Microsoft Forms now supports live data sync to Microsoft Excel with more functionality</i> (July 2024), Microsoft Forms is introducing a new data sync solution with higher reliability to sync Forms response data to Microsoft Excel for the web. Before this rollout. Forms supported an older version of live data sync to Excel.<b> The older version of live data sync will be replaced by the newer solution on January 13, 2025 and for GCC on February 13, 2025.</b> This message describes the support that we will provide for migrating from the older solution to the newer solution.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID 410988.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): Support for migrating the older data sync to the new solution will begin rolling out in late October 2024 (previously early October). We expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously early October).&nbsp;</p><p>General Availability (GCC) Support for migrating the older data sync to the new solution will begin rolling out in early January 2025 (previously late November). We expect to complete by late January 2025 (previously mid-December 2024).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Users who rely on the older version to sync data from Forms to Excel will need to manually update the data sync to the new solution before January 13, 2025 (previously October 20, 2024). After this date, existing Excel files with the older data sync will be retained but will no longer receive automatic data updates from Forms.<br></p><p>The older version of the data sync exists in two types of Forms:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Forms created from Microsoft OneDrive and Excel for the web \n</li><li>Group forms created with SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft 365 Groups.\n</li></ul><p>For these two types of Forms, we will provide this support to migrate to the new solution:</p><ul><li>Users who own Forms with the older version of the data sync will get notifications through email, Forms, and Excel for the web.</li><li>In Forms, users will be able to recreate the data sync with the new solution. The data sync will be created to the same table in the existing workbook as the older data sync. The new worksheet will be connected to the latest data from Forms.</li><li>After the older solution is retired, the user can still recreate a new data sync to the Excel workbook. \n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>For workflows that connect to Excel data from Forms responses (such as Power Automate workflows), users will need to update the workflow to the Forms connector for new response updates.

If users want to receive new Forms response data in the Excel desktop app, open the file in Excel for the web, and then wait for the desktop app file to sync from the web file.

Once administrators are within the Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) Solution on Microsoft Purview, they can visit the Priority Cleanup tab and follow the wizard to set-up this policy. Like auto-apply retention labels, Priority Cleanup supports policy simulation mode, so administrators can check the returned samples in case the policy configuration needs any fine-tuning before enabling the policy. Once set-up, because the deletion by a priority cleanup policy is irreversible and can override existing holds, the process requires multiple approvals, specific roles, and is audited.

This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in March 2025. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>A new <code>csTeamsAIPolicy</code> policy for Microsoft Teams (available now via Microsoft PowerShell and taking effect in mid-February 2025) will give IT admins more control over voice and face enrollment settings, allowing organizations to manage these features based on their needs. After rollout, voice and face profile enrollment <b>will be enabled by default</b>, and users can benefit from voice isolation, speaker recognition, and attribution in meeting rooms, resulting in smarter meeting recaps and enhanced functionality for Microsoft 365 Copilot in meetings.

Please review for updated information and timing.</p><p>In today’s security climate, our work across the company and greater industry to keep this critical ecosystem secure is more important than ever. And while we also ship bug fixes and other new features via continuous innovation, in the end security is job one.\n</p><p>Keeping Microsoft Teams up to date is critical to ensure your devices are secure and compliant.  By default, and as designed, Teams updates automatically which successfully updates most clients in the world without additional overhead for customers. \n</p><p>Microsoft Teams is governed by the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a> which requires that the Teams desktop client be kept up to date.  This is not a new policy, for instance in MC298823 (November 2021), a version that is far out of date will become incompatible with the service until it’s updated.  As <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">documented</a>, when a client falls out of date, the user will see:\n</p><ul><li>Recurring in-app alerts, if the app is between 30d-90d out of date. Except in VDI environments, where this will occur between 60-90 days out of date.</li><li>A blocking page in Teams, if the app is greater than 90 days out of date.  At this point, the app will show options to update, to contact their IT administrator, or continue to Teams on the web.  \n</li></ul><p>As an example, if the Teams app is hypothetically on a version released on January 1 and the next update is fully available on January 15, an in-app alert would be shown on February 14th (30 days after the January 15th update).  \n</p><p>For reference, link to the Teams app's  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/teams-app-versioning\" target=\"_blank\">version's release dates</a>.  Also, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-usage-report\" target=\"_blank\">The Microsoft Teams desktop client usage report</a> gives you an overview of the Teams desktop clients in use within your organization.\n</p><p>Classic Teams is not in scope for this post; see MC783985 for Classic Teams Timelines regarding end of support and end of availability.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>The existing policy enforcement will be visible beginning January 14th, 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>New Teams - Windows &amp; Mac Versions desktop clients (not running in a VDI environment)</p><ul><li>Beginning January 14th, 2025, Teams desktop clients more than 30 days out of date, will present a banner or notification to users that they are on an outdated version of Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Beginning February 18th, 2025, Teams desktop clients older than 90 days out of date, will present a blocking page.

      "Content": "<p>Updated December 17, 2024: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137\" target=\"_blank\">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q4 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 90 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP will follow closer to the start of Preview.</p>\n\n \n<table><tbody>\n\n<tr><th>OEM</th>\n<th>Device Type</th>\n<th>Models</th>\n<th>Targeted Release</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>AudioCodes</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>C470HD</td>\n<td>Dec-24</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td><td>Phones</td>\n<td>C430HD\n<br>C435HD\n<br>C455HD<br></td>\n<td>Jan-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RXV81<br>RXV200<br>RXPad<br></td>\n<td>Dec-24</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Audiocodes</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>RX Panel</td>\n<td>Dec-24</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TSS-770<br>TSS-1070<br></td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Crestron AIO Video Bar 70 \n<br>Crestron Touch Panel TS-1070<br></td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Cisco Room Bar\n<br>Cisco Room Bar Pro \n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQ \n<br>Cisco Room Kit Pro\n<br>Cisco Desk Pro\n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQX \n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 55\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 55 \n<br>Cisco Navigator<br></td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Cisco Navigator Panel</td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>DTEN</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>DTEN D7X 75\"\n<br>DTEN D7X 55\" \n<br>DTEN Bar\n<br>DTEN Mate TC<br></td>\n<td>Jan-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Jabra</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Jabra Panacast 50 VBS\n<br>Jabra Panacast 50 TC<br></td>\n<td>Jan-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RallyBar <b>VR0019</b>\n<br>RallyBar mini <b>VR0020</b>\n<br>TAP IP <b>VR0029</b>\n<br>TAP\n<br>RoomMate <b>VR0030</b>\n<br>Logi Rallybar Huddle (VR0034]<br></td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Tap Scheduler  <b>VR0028</b>\n<br>DockFlex <b>VR0035</b><br></td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar <b>NF19B1</b> \n<br>Neat Board <b>NF19C1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Pro <b>NF21D1</b>\n<br>Neat Bar Gen2 <b>NF22E1</b>\n<br>Neat Board 50 <b>NF22H1</b>\n<br>Neat Board Pro 65  <b>NF23K1</b><br></td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Neat Pad <b>NF19A1</b></td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Displays</td><td>Neat Frame <b>NF21F1</b></td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>CCX350 \n<br>CCX400\n<br>CCX500\n<br>CCX505\n<br>CCX600\n<br>TrioC60<br></td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Poly Studio X30\n<br>Poly Studio X50\n<br>Poly Studio X52\n<br>Poly Studio X70\n<br>Poly Studio X72\n<br>Poly Studio G7500\n<br>Poly Studio G62\n<br>Poly TC8\n<br>Poly TC10<br></td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TC10 - Panel</td>\n<td>Feb-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X</b></td>\n<td>MP54\n<br>MP56\n<br>MP58\n<br>CP965<br></td>\n<td>Jan-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  <b>MP5X E2</b></td>\n<td>MP52E2\n<br>MP54E2\n<br>MP56E2 \n<br>MP58E2<br></td>\n<td>Jan-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A10\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A20\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A30\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A40\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 65\"\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 86\"\n<br>Yealink Deskvision A24\n<br>Yealink CTP18 \n<br>Yealink CTP25<br></td>\n<td>Jan-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel\n<br>RoomPanel Plus\n<br>Room Panel E2\n<br>RoomPanel Plus E2<br></td>\n<td>Jan-25</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n</tbody></table>",

      "Content": "<p>We are excited to announce the Public Preview of the new version of Message trace in the Microsoft Exchange admin center (EAC) in Microsoft Exchange Online. Admins will soon be able to access the new Message trace and its capabilities by default in the Exchange admin center &gt; <i>Mail flow &gt; Message trace.</i> Also, admins will be able to use the new Message trace functionality using Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet <code>Get-MessageTraceV2</code> (similar to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-messagetrace?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Get-MessageTrace (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a>).\n</p><p>The new Message trace will be toggled <i>On</i> by default after being deployed to your tenant. If you wish to disable the preview, you can change the toggle to <i>Off</i> in the Message trace flyout. To use the new Message trace functionality through the PowerShell cmdlet Get-MessageTraceV2, please ensure you are using version 3.7.0 or later of the Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-December 2024 and expect to complete by late December 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><b>Key functionality changes</b>\n</p><ul><li>Extended query range: You can query up to 90 days of historical data for near real-time queries. However, please note that you can only query 10 days of data at a time. Please note that you will initially only have 30 days of historical data for near real-time query, and this will build over time to 90 days of historical data.\n</li><li>Subject filter: You can select a subject filter for Message trace queries, such as <i>Starts with, Ends with, </i>and <i>Contains</i> functions. This filter also supports special characters.\n</li><li>Delivery status filter: The delivery status filter will now support searches for <i>Quarantined, Filtered as spam, </i>and <i>Getting status</i> statuses.\n</li></ul><p><i>Additional updates</i>\n</p><ul><li>Customizable columns: For your search results, we’ve introduced customizable columns and added additional column options. <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/announcing-public-preview-of-the-new-message-trace-in-exchange-online/4356561\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the new columns</a>.\n</li><li>Persistent column widths: You will be able to customize your column widths, and these changes will persist in each logged-on admin account, so you will not have to reset column widths each time you run a new Message trace query. This update is still in progress and will be made available in early-February.\n</li><li>Wider flyout option: An option for a wider flyout for the Message trace detail will be available.\n</li><li>Time zone consistency: Message trace will default to the time zone set in the Exchange account settings of the logged-on admin.\n</li></ul><p><b>Key cmdlet changes in </b><code>Get-MessageTraceV2</code> (relative to <code>Get-MessageTrace</code>)\n</p><ul><li>Extended query range: You can query up to 90 days of historical data. However, please note that you will only be able to query 10 days of data per query. Please note that you will initially only have 30 days of historical data for near real-time query, and this will build over time to 90 days of historical data.\n</li><li>Subject parameter: You can filter by subject for more specific Message trace queries.\n</li><li>No page number or page size parameter: Pagination will not be supported in <code>Get-MessageTraceV2</code>. This change is to ensure fair use of our resources, as pagination can create performance issues for our system.\n</li><li>Result size parameter: The new Message trace will support a default value of 1000 results and a maximum of 5000 results (set through the <code>-ResultSize</code> parameter), which is a significant increase.\n</li><li><code>StartingRecipientAddress</code> parameter: This parameter’s main use is to assist in pulling subsequent data while minimizing duplication.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As an alternative to pagination, you can set the EndDate parameter with the Received time of the last record of the previous query results and fill in the <code>StartingRecipientAddresss</code> parameter with the <code>RecipientAddress</code> of the last record of the previous result.\n</p><p><i>Known differences and ongoing updates</i>\n</p><ul><li>Message trace V1 normalizes all recipients to lowercase, while V2 retains any capitalization in Message tracking logs.\n</li><li>When displaying results, V2 will order by <code>Received</code> in descending order first, and then by <code>RecipientAddress</code> in ascending order(case-insensitive).\n</li><li>In some rare cases, <code>FromIp</code> may be missing in V2, but we are working to fix this issue.\n</li><li>For messages with over 1000 recipients, admins must include the <code>MessageTraceId</code> in both the EAC experience and PowerShell cmdlet queries to avoid partial results.\n</li><li>For quarantine scenarios, V2 will display the latest status while V1 displayed the original status. For example, if the email is initially quarantined and then released later by the admin, Message trace v2 will show the latest status that is delivered to mailbox.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/announcing-public-preview-of-the-new-message-trace-in-exchange-online/4356561\" target=\"_blank\">Announcing Public Preview of the New Message Trace in Exchange Online | Microsoft Community Hub</a> (December 16, 2014).\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Important update regarding the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit</b>: After carefully considering your feedback and understanding the need for additional time to adjust, Microsoft has decided to delay the rollout of the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit (MERRL) by ~six months. The MERRL will go into enforcement in October 2025 for trial tenants and new tenants provisioned after October 1st, 2025. In October 2025, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In April 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all tenant's cloud hosted mailboxes including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/prepare-email-communication-resource\" target=\"_blank\">Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn</a>), or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn), or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in January 2025, Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

In addition, we are evolving the app's UI to support future AI-first experiences. Key changes include reducing the top app header, consolidating all app-level tools and settings into the App toolbar on the left, and retiring features like Help me create and My Day from the app.\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b>\n</p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app (web, Windows) starting in mid-January 2025. This is a phased rollout, so not all users will receive the update simultaneously.\n</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With these updates, users will notice the following changes:\n</p><ul><li>The app will no longer have a top header. Instead, tools like user profile, settings, and feedback will move to the bottom left toolbar. The feedback button will be available under the 'Settings and more' section in the bottom left toolbar.\n</li><li>The search box will now be presented on the Homepage for users to find all their content across multiple file types and storage locations. Note: There is no change to the search experience—only the placement of the feature.\n</li><li>All the apps on the left tool bar are aligned to the top and the AI rich experiences like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages will be presented together to establish correlation.\n</li><li>The organization logo, previously displayed in the top header under the Organization theme, will no longer be visible in the app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where the organization logo will still appear in the header.\n</li><li>The 'Back' button on the Windows Microsoft 365 Copilot app will not be available. Users will still be able to use the left AppBar to navigate between pages. \n</li><li>The 'My Day' feature is being removed from the app experience, and users will no longer see the button to launch the calendar and to-do on the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where My Day feature is available.\n</li><li>The 'Help me create' feature will be retired from the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Launched in February 2024, ‘Help me create’ was focused on helping users go from their stated intent to document creation using an LLM. With Microsoft 365 Copilot app becoming the destination for Copilot, we will be bringing AI powered document creation into Copilot tab. Users will be able to brainstorm ideas and draft new content based on a storyboard or a script to an agenda or an executive summary from Copilot Chat.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin or user action is required as these changes roll out. However, we recommend keeping your users informed about these updates to ensure they are aware that these changes are part of the app enhancements.</p>",

Device admins will now have the ability to manage these operations without affecting end-user experience, ensuring smoother and uninterrupted device usage.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=418120\" target=\"_blank\">418120</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out late February 2025 and expect to complete by early March 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This change will significantly enhance the user experience by ensuring that device operations such as software updates, restarts, and configuration updates are carried out only when the device is idle. This means meetings or calls will no longer be interrupted by these operations. This change will be applicable for Teams Rooms on Android, Panels, Phones, and Displays.\n</p><p>This change will require an update for Teams app and the Teams admin agent app to take effect. We will update this message closer to the release date with details about the required versions.\n</p><p>With this change, the following device operations will automatically function in a non-disruptive way:\n</p><ul><li>Software update\n</li><li>Device restart\n</li><li>Configuration update\n</li></ul><p>This change will be applicable for operations created by administrators manually from Teams admin center or the Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal, as well as those being carried out automatically.\n</p><p><u>How this will work:</u></p><p>At the time of execution, the device status is checked. The execution goes forward only if the device is free (no ongoing meeting or call) and has no upcoming scheduled event on the calendar.\n</p><p>A few minutes before the execution starts, the device shows a notification for the end-users, informing them that the operation is about to start. The device users get an option to Postpone the execution if they want to use the device.\n</p><p>The execution of the operation does not start if the device is busy, or has upcoming scheduled events on the calendar, or the end-user has opted to postpone the execution. The device status is checked at regular intervals for a safe window for execution.\n</p><p>The status of the operation is available in Teams admin center. Admins can view the details on the device page under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#manage-phones-teams-rooms-on-android-teams-displays-and-teams-panels\" target=\"_blank\">History tab</a>.\n</p><p>This ensures that the end-users do not face any disturbance while they are using Teams devices.\n</p><p><u style=\"\">Additional aspects</u>\n</p><p>There could be scenarios where the devices are extremely busy thus delaying the execution of the operation. Administrators will have an option to decide the execution approach if the execution is unable to start even after 24 hrs. There are two options:\n</p><ul><li>The operation is cancelled after having tried for 24 hrs<b>.</b> There will be no impact on the device. If the administrator created this operation, they can come back can create it again. <u>This is the default behavior.\n</u></li><li>The operation is force-executed after having tried for 24 hrs. This option will execute the operation, but the status of the device will not be checked at this point. This may cause some disruption if the device is in use.\n</li></ul><p>The option to cancel or force the execution of the operations after the 24-hr search of a safe-execution window can be configured from Teams admin center through the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#use-configuration-profiles-in-teams\" target=\"_blank\" );\"=\"\">Configuration profiles</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>The changes will take effect automatically after updating the devices to the required Teams app and Teams admin agent versions. The updates will happen automatically, but admins can choose to update manually also. The details about the required versions will be announced closer to the release date. Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/remote-update\" target=\"_blank\">Update Microsoft Teams devices remotely - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a> for more details about updating devices.\n</p><p>Admins should familiarize themselves with the new controls available in the Teams admin center. They should ensure that they configure the settings appropriately to suit their organization's needs. Additionally, it's recommended to communicate these changes to end-users, so they are aware of the improved experience and new notifications they might receive regarding device operations.\n</p><p>We believe this feature will greatly improve the reliability and user experience of Teams devices in your organization.\n</p><p>For any clarification, feel free to reach out to Microsoft Support.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

Similarly, to set up <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bring-your-own-device\" target=\"_blank\">BYOD rooms</a> (rooms without Microsoft Teams Rooms that are equipped with devices such as a speaker puck or other peripherals), admins must associate these devices to a room account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Finally, in order for a user’s work location to be updated to a specific building, an admin must onboard their buildings<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/places/get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors?branch=main\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>and parent the workspace or room resource account to the buildings.</p><p>After these steps are complete, admins have the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsworklocationdetectionpolicy?view=teams-ps\" target=\"_blank\">option to opt-in</a> for automatic location updates. This can be enabled at a tenant level or for a specific user group. Once admins have enabled this feature, users will have the opportunity to opt-in. They can do so in Teams under <i>Settings &gt; Privacy</i>. After users have opted-in, their work location will automatically update to a specific building when they connect to a bookable desk or BYOD room. Note that if a workspace or room resource account does not have a building, the user's work location will automatically update to “In the office” upon plug-in rather than update to the specific building</p><p>To facilitate discovery of this feature, after tenant opt-in, the following banner will be shown the first time a user plugs into a bookable desk or BYOD room.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/be3a63d0-1058-4050-8164-a97cfc72fb47\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><br></p><p>Once a user enables automatic location updates, the following banner will be displayed only once for the user’s convenience and confirmation that the location update was successful on their first subsequent plug-in to bookable desks or BYOD room.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f79a81e-12b8-40bf-a935-c730b7c0c832\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this feature, we strongly recommend communicating this new feature to your users and admin team and sharing instructions if needed.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview: We are excited to announce upcoming enhancements to Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP). With the forthcoming update, the capability to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows endpoint devices will be significantly expanded. The number of supported file types will increase from approximately 40 to over 100, aligning endpoint coverage with other platforms like Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. Additionally, this update will introduce several key enhancements, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Detection of labels from protected files (pfiles).\n</li><li>Identification of sensitive content within file metadata.\n</li><li>Recognition of sensitive information in PDF form fields.</li><li>Detection of sensitive information in files embedded inside office files (for example, a .txt file inside .pptx file)</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=171586\" target=\"_blank\">171586</a></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June (previously late July) 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously late mid-February.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The upcoming update will enhance DLP's content scanning on Windows devices. No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles). This means that it can now read labels not just from Office and PDF files, but all other files where MIP label with protection can be applied via applications like AIP client, Secude etc. which converts the file into “pfile”.</p><p>Picture 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8c4d2426-7164-4710-900b-2bd8667b59ca\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>A txt file converted to .ptxt (PFile) after applying a label. This label can now be detected with this preview.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\tScanning metadata\n</p>\n\n<p>Ability to detect sensitive content in file metadata like custom properties in Office and PDF files.</p><p>Picture 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/22b5d8fe-a5ef-4d5e-b810-a74f9ea7dc49\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>4.\tScanning content embedded in Microsoft 365 office files\n</p>\n\n<p>If a file is embedded inside an office file (Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint), the content of the embedded file is also scanned. For example, if a DOCX file containing credit card numbers is inserted into an XLSX file, the content of both XLSX and the embedded DOCX files will be scanned, and credit card numbers will be detected.\n</p><p>Picture 3:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/cab0da75-319b-40bc-967f-b8c6766611e7\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>5.\tBetter scanning with PDF files\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in PDF forms.\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in permission protected PDF files. Permission protected PDF files are ones which do not require any password to open the file and read the content but require a password to edit/copy the content.\n</p>\n\n<p>Picture 4:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/453bd3df-d597-4e9d-ab89-43f90a87f4f8\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>You do not need do any changes to your existing policies.

      "Content": "<p>Updated November 19, 2024: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In Exchange Online PowerShell (EXO) V3.0, we introduced the <code>Connect-ExchangeOnline</code> cmdlet to connect to the Microsoft Exchange Online environment through Microsoft PowerShell, which loads the help file by default. This help file is required for running the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. However, not many customers used the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. In EXO V3.3, we added the <code>-SkipLoadingCmdletHelp</code> parameter. When <code>-SkipLoadingCmdletHelp</code> is used with <code>Connect-ExchangeOnline</code>, help files do not load the on the customer system, which saves resources. \n</p><p>However, starting with EXO V3.7, we are changing this default behavior. The Help file will not be loaded by default, and a new parameter <code>-LoadCmdletHelp</code> will be required to load the cmdlet help and use the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. To avoid breaking existing scripts, the <code>-SkipLoadingCmdletHelp</code> parameter will continue exist, but will not function.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The changes will be available in EXO V3.7 (the next release of our EXO V3 module) in late November 2024 (previously early November).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Starting with EXO V3.7, if you want to use the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet, you will have to use the parameter <code>-LoadCmdletHelp</code> along with <code>Connect-ExchangeOnline</code>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This message only applies to customers who upgrade their EXO module version to 3.7.0. Earlier versions will not be affected by these changes.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Similar to app centric management for app availability, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023), admins will be able to install apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.\n</p><p>After rollout, app centric management will replace<i> Installed apps</i> in the Teams admin center and give admins the ability to install apps individually. The <i>Installed apps</i> in your app setup policies will be migrated to app centric management based on your current user and group assignments for each policy.

At that time, administrators will be able to self-initiate the migration using the wizard. The automatic migration for customers with only a global permission policy (Phase 1) and those with multiple permission policies (Phase 3) will be postponed until early 2025. Further updates, including the details for Phase 3 auto-migration, will be provided in a future MC post update and public documentation.</p><p style=\"\">App centric management (ACM) is on hold    as of August 14, 2024, and will restart in mid-October (previously mid-September). Your experience during this hold will fall under one of the following, with Phases defined in detail below.\n</p><ul><li>If your tenant has already been migrated to ACM, it will remain on ACM. The rest of this MC post is not applicable to your tenant.\n</li><li>If your tenant fell under the Phase 1 criteria of using only the Global app permission policy and no custom app permission policies, it will resume auto migration in mid-September.\n</li><li>If you do not have a draft currently saved, you will not be able to access ACM migration until the roll out restarts.<br></li></ul><p style=\"\">What is in Phase 2?\n</p><ul><li>Migration wizard: a step-by-step guide to help you migrate the permission policies. You will be able to select which polities to migrate and designate users groups or individuals who should have access to the apps.\n</li><li>Testing and Validation: before finalizing the migration, you will have the opportunity to test and export your staged changes. You can use this to make side-by-side comparison with your current setup, ensuring everything is perfect before you proceed.\n</li><li>Duration: The migration process is designed to have no downtime for the end users and can take a few hours to complete.

First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to the Teams app store. Second, admins can manage apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization. This feature replaces the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. The app permission policies for existing customers are migrated to maintain existing app availability in the tenant. \n</p><p style=\"\">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID 151829\n</p><p style=\"\"><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p style=\"\">This feature will gradually roll out across three major phases. \n</p><p style=\"\"><i>Phase 1</i> (from late November 2023 to early November 2024 (previously late September) affects the tenants that use only the Global app permission policy and have no custom app permission policies.

The admins will have the choice to modify the apps that are assigned using the custom permission policies to be accessible to groups, if they want.</p><p style=\"\"><i>Phase 3</i> (early 2025) applies to the tenants that skipped the migration in phase 1 or 2.

Copilot Pages is a dynamic, persistent canvas in Copilot chat designed for multi-player collaboration.

We see collaboration using Copilot Pages as the next great step forward in evolving Copilot from an individual, point-in-time exercise into a collaborative experience. \n</p><p>You can return to a page at any time by clicking the link in chat or the Open Page icon at the top of the associated Copilot session. Additionally, users can view all their pages in the Pages module in Microsoft365.com where they can also collaborate with others. \n</p><p>Created pages are stored in a user-owned SharePoint Embedded container.

This policy provides four actions: <i>Off, Monitor, Block, </i>and <i>Dynamic delivery.</i> We made the <i>Monitor </i>action available for customers who wanted a <i>Safe attachments</i> policy to process attachments, deliver the emails (without blocking malicious attachments), and track what happened with attachments identified as malicious.  Customers used <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#reports-for-your-evaluation-or-trial-of-defender-for-office-365\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a>to see detections from the <i>Monitor </i>action in the policy.\n</p><p>As part of this retirement, if your organization has <i>Safe attachments</i> policies set to the <i>Monitor </i>action, we will automatically change the action in from <i>Monitor </i>to <i>Block.</i> We will not change the policy's recipients, status, or priority. After retirement, the <i>Monitor </i>option will not be available in the Safe Attachments policy page in the Defender security portal or the corresponding Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet.\n</p><p>Before retirement, you can find the <i>Monitor </i>action in Defender &gt; <i>Email &amp; collaboration &gt; Policies &amp; rules &gt; Threat policies &gt; Safe attachments &gt;</i> choose a policy or create a new policy &gt;<i> Edit settings</i> (or <i>Settings </i>if creating a new policy).

      "Content": "<p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) in September 2025. After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be making this change in September 2025.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In September 2024, we will update the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. In January 2025, we will send a Message Center post to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change. In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/high-volume-mails-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage high volume emails for Microsoft 365 Public preview</a></li><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal and external to your tenant, you can use Azure Communication Services Email. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of Azure Communication Services email</a></li><li> If you have an Exchange Server on-premises in a hybrid configuration, you can use Basic auth to authenticate with the Exchange Server on-premises or configure the Exchange Server on-premises with a Receive connector that allows anonymous relay on Exchange servers.

To make the process more efficient, when you run the initial search request and request private content, an on-demand index is provisioned to serve “private” results.  The time required to build the index depends on the number of items in your users’ OneDrive and SharePoint.  For a medium-to-large tenant, this may take days to a week to complete.  Very large tenants will take longer.  While the index is provisioning, search requests will only return shared and public content.  Once the new index is complete, private and shared content will be returned.  If no additional search requests for private content are sent within 100 days, the private index will be decommissioned.  If needed again, a subsequent search request for private content will rebuild the index.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have applications which run infrequently (e.g. every four months) and use Search with Application Permissions, plan for time to allow the on-demand index to rebuild. \n</p><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/search-concept-searchall?view=graph-rest-1.0\" target=\"_blank\">Search content with application permissions - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p>",

Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1. Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

If you are currently following this guidance, <i>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</i></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

These changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants.*\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 90 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 90 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules.

After this rollout, license enforcement will not apply to the Global admin or Engage admin roles.\n</p><p>This rollout does not apply to other roles, including Yammer Network Administrator, Yammer Verified Administrator, Corporate Communicator, Answers Administrator, and Community Administrator. These roles will continue to require a “Viva Engage Core” service plan when the tenant is configured to require a per-user license.\n</p><p>Note: Engage admins and Global admins who wish to access Viva Engage inside the Microsoft Teams application should ensure they have access to the right licensing required to access Teams. Learn more about licensing for Teams: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/teams-products\" target=\"_blank\">All Microsoft Teams Product Plans | Microsoft Teams</a>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b> \n</p><ul><li>You can choose to unassign the “Viva Engage core” and/or the “Yammer enterprise” service plan from Engage admins/ Global admins, since it’s no longer a prerequisite to access Viva Engage, Engage admin center or the legacy network admin center.\n</li><li>You can also choose to unassign the entire Microsoft 365 seat for these roles if it was earlier assigned for the sole purpose of Viva Engage administration.\n</li><li>Consider using the Engage admin role within Entra ID as more Engage experiences integrate with the rest of Microsoft 365. The Verified Administrator role is internal to Engage and not recognized by applications relying on Entra ID. \n</li></ul><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>We will update this comm before rollout with revised documentation.</p>",

Here is a list of features offered in Delve and the experiences we recommend using instead:\n</p><ul><li>Delve Home – discover relevant documents recommended on Office.com, in Office apps and  in Profile Cards.\n</li><li>Delve Profile – view profile data in the Profile Cards cross M365, through people in search on Office.com and search in SharePoint.\n</li><li>Edit profile – a new edit profile experience tightly coupled with Profile Cards are being developed and will be released in second half of 2024. It is also possible for users to edit their profile data in the SharePoint profile edit experience (editprofile.aspx). \n</li><li>Organizational view – exists in the Profile Card and as a dedicated experience in Org Explorer\n</li><li>Favorites – favorites on Office.com and OneDrive is not connected to Delve and is a good option for users with similar functionality and improved availability. \n</li><li>Boards – will not be replaced.\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>December 16, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>You are receiving this message because Delve web is available to most customers in Microsoft 365.

Please note that Delve and the new edit profile experience will work side by side until Delve is retired. \n</p><p>Users will no longer be able to create new boards, add documents to existing boards, view boards or search for boards when this change is implemented. Please note that documents themselves will NOT be removed. It is only the association with one or multiple boards that will be removed.\n</p><p>The new edit profile experience will for now read and write to the same source as Delve does, thus there are no changes in how admins can modify user profile properties.<br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend updating internal documentation and training related to Delve with the suggested alternatives.

Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.

If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 11, 2024: We have updated the content to reflect the change to Viva Engage. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is strongly recommended that you back up your data and communicate the migration to your users prior to your scheduled migration start date. If your alignment report reveals any blockers to migration, you can log an exception with support.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule your migration around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.</p><p><br></p>",

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",
