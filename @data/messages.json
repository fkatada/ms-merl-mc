We will be introducing a checkbox on February 8, 2025, for tenant admins to accept Microsoft’s default selection (off for entire organization) for this specific setting. The default value for this setting will be turned on or after March 8th if Fabric admins do not take any action.</p><p>This update helps enhance visibility and ease of access for our customers, ensuring you're aware of and can leverage this functionality effortlessly. \n</p><p>Note also, billing for compute usage and data storage for SQL databases in Fabric commenced after February 1st, with backup charges following after April 1st. For the latest updates on billing practices and to ensure you are fully informed on how charges are applied, please refer to the following detailed blog post: Monitor SQL database usage and consumption in Microsoft Fabric.</p><p>\n</p><p><i>Why are we updating this setting?</i></p><p><b>  \n</b></p><p>The update to our tenant settings is designed to ensure Fabric admins can act based on their organizational policy before the setting is enabled by default. From February 8, 2025, when the checkbox is available to March 8, 2025, admins can assess impact and act on enablement. By setting SQL database in Fabric as a default option, we ensure that you don’t miss out on leveraging its full potential right from the start. This change reflects our commitment to enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.</p><p><b>When This Will Happen:</b></p><p><b> \n</b></p><ol><li>The default activation of the checkbox for SQL database in Fabric is scheduled to commence on March 8th, 2025\n</li><li>Billing for compute and data storage for SQL databases in Fabric commenced after February 1, 2025.

If your organization prefers not to have this setting enabled by default, tenant admins must manually turn OFF this setting within the next 30 days.</li><li>We encourage you to assess these new settings and make any necessary changes to align with your organization's compliance and data storage policies.</li></ul></li><li>Review and Prepare for Billing Start:<ul><li>As billing for compute and data storage commenced after February 1, 2025, and backup charges will commence after April 1, 2025, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive review of your current and projected usage to anticipate charges.\n</li></ul></li></ol><p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.</p>",

We will provide a subsequent update by the end of February with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>Starting February 3 (previously December 1), we're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online.\n</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Python in Excel allows you to bring the capabilities of Python directly into the Microsoft Excel grid. In September 2024, Python in Excel with standard compute became generally available to all eligible users with access to Excel for Windows. With this upcoming rollout, Python in Excel will also be generally available in Microsoft Excel for the web for all eligible users.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=471001\" target=\"_blank\">471001</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late March 2025.</p>\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, Python in Excel is only available to eligible users with access to Excel for Windows. After this rollout, eligible users with access to Excel for the web will be able to add Python formulas to their workbooks without any installation required. These Python formulas will be run by Excel in a secure container on the <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/data-security-and-python-in-excel-33cc88a4-4a87-485e-9ff9-f35958278327\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Cloud</a> with enterprise-level security and with standard compute. With this release, eligible Excel for the web users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will also be able to use the <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/copilot-in-excel-with-python-364e4ae9-9343-4d56-952a-5f62b0f70db6\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot in Excel with Python</a> feature, enabling them to leverage the capabilities of AI and Python in Excel for deeper data analysis.\n</p><p><b>Note: </b>A Python in Excel add-on license gives users premium Python compute for faster calculation times for more powerful data analysis. Some premium Python compute will be included in each user’s Microsoft 365 subscription each month, giving users limited access to faster calculation speeds. After they have used all of their included premium compute, they can continue to use the Python in Excel feature with standard Python compute or choose to purchase or request a Python in Excel add-on license from in-app prompts.\n</p><p>If you would like users in your organization to have full access to premium Python compute, you can purchase and assign them a Python in Excel add-on license in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The Python in Excel add-on license is also offered as a <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/allowselfservicepurchase-powershell?view=o365-worldwide#view-a-list-of-self-service-purchase-products-and-their-status\" target=\"_blank\">self-service purchased product</a>, which means that eligible end users will be able to request a license or purchase a license through in-app prompts in Excel for the web. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/self-service-purchase-faq?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about self-service purchases.</a>\n</p><p>If you have disabled self-service purchases in your tenant, the end user will instead be able to submit a license request to you.

Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 90 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

We provide recommendations for apps that are popular in a user's tenant.

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 15, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through early March 2025 (previously January 1). You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled.

This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Please note that information about meeting link expiry changes related to this rollout has been added.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 (previously mid-February) and expect to complete by late April 2025 (previously late March). \n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out early June 2025 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late June 2025 (previously late April).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

Like auto-apply retention labels, Priority Cleanup supports policy simulation mode, so administrators can check the returned samples in case the policy configuration needs any fine-tuning before enabling the policy. Once set-up, because the deletion by a priority cleanup policy is irreversible and can override existing holds, the process requires multiple approvals, specific roles, and is audited. Thus, respective reviewers must be mandatorily added during policy creation to allow for disposition of items under a retention or e-Discovery hold.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Because of the built-in safeguards, the feature itself is enabled by default at the tenant level. However, Priority Cleanup can be turned off on the Priority Cleanup settings page.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late-January 2025 (previously mid-December 2024) and expect to complete late March 2025 (previously mid-January 2025). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in March 2025. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

Through the new <b><i>Feature Access management user interface</i></b>, admins will be able to manage feature access settings directly in the MAC.

Previously, these policies could only be managed with Microsoft PowerShell cmdlets. After this rollout, admins can choose to use either the MAC or PowerShell to manage feature access. Existing policies set for an organization will persist and can be managed in both places.

Please review for updated information and timing.</p><p>In today’s security climate, our work across the company and greater industry to keep this critical ecosystem secure is more important than ever. And while we also ship bug fixes and other new features via continuous innovation, in the end security is job one.\n</p><p>Keeping Microsoft Teams up to date is critical to ensure your devices are secure and compliant.  By default, and as designed, Teams updates automatically which successfully updates most clients in the world without additional overhead for customers. \n</p><p>Microsoft Teams is governed by the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a> which requires that the Teams desktop client be kept up to date.  This is not a new policy, for instance in MC298823 (November 2021), a version that is far out of date will become incompatible with the service until it’s updated.  As <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">documented</a>, when a client falls out of date, the user will see:\n</p><ul><li>Recurring in-app alerts, if the app is between 30d-90d out of date. Except in VDI environments, where this will occur between 60-90 days out of date.</li><li>A blocking page in Teams, if the app is greater than 90 days out of date.  At this point, the app will show options to update, to contact their IT administrator, or continue to Teams on the web.  \n</li></ul><p>As an example, if the Teams app is hypothetically on a version released on January 1 and the next update is fully available on January 15, an in-app alert would be shown on February 14th (30 days after the January 15th update).  \n</p><p>For reference, link to the Teams app's  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/teams-app-versioning\" target=\"_blank\">version's release dates</a>.  Also, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-usage-report\" target=\"_blank\">The Microsoft Teams desktop client usage report</a> gives you an overview of the Teams desktop clients in use within your organization.\n</p><p>Classic Teams is not in scope for this post; see MC783985 for Classic Teams Timelines regarding end of support and end of availability.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>The existing policy enforcement will be visible beginning January 14th, 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>New Teams - Windows &amp; Mac Versions desktop clients (not running in a VDI environment)</p><ul><li>Beginning January 14th, 2025, Teams desktop clients more than 30 days out of date, will present a banner or notification to users that they are on an outdated version of Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Beginning February 18th, 2025, Teams desktop clients older than 90 days out of date, will present a blocking page.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><b>Important update regarding the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit</b>: After carefully considering your feedback and understanding the need for additional time to adjust, Microsoft has decided to delay the rollout of the cloud hosted Mailbox External Recipient Rate Limit (MERRL) by ~six months. The MERRL will go into enforcement in October 2025 for trial tenants and new tenants provisioned after October 1st, 2025. In October 2025, the Exchange Admin Center Report will be available for tenant admins to review Sender mailbox data on external recipient volume. In April 2026, the MERRL will go into enforcement for all tenant's cloud hosted mailboxes including existing tenants.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/prepare-email-communication-resource\" target=\"_blank\">Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn</a>), or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">We have made the decision to not proceed with this change for DoD, GCC, or GCC High organizations at this time. We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Please refer to the ACS email documentation (Prepare an email communication resource for Azure Communication Services - An Azure Communication Services concept article | Microsoft Learn), or reach out to your Microsoft account team for further support in this journey.\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">________________________________________\n</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\"><br></p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in January 2025, Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2.

      "Content": "<p>As noted in MC958903, we are updating the Microsoft 365 app name and icon to Microsoft 365 Copilot in mid-January 2025. In addition, we are evolving the app's UI to support future AI-first experiences. Key changes include reducing the top app header, consolidating all app-level tools and settings into the App toolbar on the left, and retiring features like Help me create and My Day from the app.\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b>\n</p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app (web, Windows) starting in mid-January 2025. This is a phased rollout, so not all users will receive the update simultaneously.\n</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With these updates, users will notice the following changes:\n</p><ul><li>The app will no longer have a top header. Instead, tools like user profile, settings, and feedback will move to the bottom left toolbar. The feedback button will be available under the 'Settings and more' section in the bottom left toolbar.\n</li><li>The search box will now be presented on the Homepage for users to find all their content across multiple file types and storage locations. Note: There is no change to the search experience—only the placement of the feature.\n</li><li>All the apps on the left tool bar are aligned to the top and the AI rich experiences like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages will be presented together to establish correlation.\n</li><li>The organization logo, previously displayed in the top header under the Organization theme, will no longer be visible in the app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where the organization logo will still appear in the header.\n</li><li>The 'Back' button on the Windows Microsoft 365 Copilot app will not be available. Users will still be able to use the left AppBar to navigate between pages. \n</li><li>The 'My Day' feature is being removed from the app experience, and users will no longer see the button to launch the calendar and to-do on the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where My Day feature is available.\n</li><li>The 'Help me create' feature will be retired from the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Launched in February 2024, ‘Help me create’ was focused on helping users go from their stated intent to document creation using an LLM. With Microsoft 365 Copilot app becoming the destination for Copilot, we will be bringing AI powered document creation into Copilot tab. Users will be able to brainstorm ideas and draft new content based on a storyboard or a script to an agenda or an executive summary from Copilot Chat.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin or user action is required as these changes roll out. However, we recommend keeping your users informed about these updates to ensure they are aware that these changes are part of the app enhancements.</p>",

Access to agents can be controlled and configured within the Microsoft 365 admin center. Specific agents, such as those that access shared work data, will be billed based on metered consumption for users without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. Agents grounded only on web data will be available to use at no additional cost.\n</p><p>The name changes for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, and the new Microsoft 365 Copilot app icon, will roll out across App stores and the web in mid-January.  \n</p><p>We are also introducing a new URL to make it easier to discover Microsoft 365 Copilot on the web: M365Copilot.com.

For more information on how to do this, please refer to the October 16th update below.</p><p>Updated October 16, 2024: Updated information related to Office 365 Connectors Retirement in Teams - Webhook URL Migration. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>&nbsp;As shared in the last communication, we are publishing guidance for owners of webhook-based connectors to update their URLs with a new structure. To allow ample time for replacing URLs, connector owners will have until <b>January 31, 2025, which is an extension from our previous deadline of December 31, 2024.</b> See below for complete guidance.</p><p>Webhook-based connectors within the O365 Connectors service in Teams are transitioning to a new URL structure due to the implementation of further service hardening updates. During this transition, you may receive notifications to update your configured connector to use the new URL. We strongly recommend that you update your connector immediately to prevent any disruption to connector services. URLs for all webhook-based connectors must be updated by January 31, 2025 for the connectors to continue posting messages into Teams. <b>Keep in mind the entire O365 Connectors service in Teams will be retired at the end of 2025</b>, so consider moving your webhooks to the Workflows app within Teams to avoid conducting another migration.

The change is not required for polling-based connectors such as RSS.</p><p>To update webhook URLs for existing O365 Connectors, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/m365-custom-connectors#update-connectors-url\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Microsoft 365 connectors and custom connectors - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>1. Go to<b> Manage Channel</b> in a Teams channel, select<b> Edit</b> under the Connectors option, and select <b>Configured </b>section. Review the existing connections listed on this page.</p><p>2.Do one of the following to generate a new URL:</p><ul><li>For connectors that contain a webhook URL, select <b>Manage</b> and <b>Update URL.</b></li><li>For other types of connectors, remove the connector and recreate the connector configuration.</li></ul><p>3. Replace the old URL with the new URL (or the new connection in the service that triggers the post). You'll know the new URL is ready for you to copy when the Configure page shows a message that the URL is updated (\"Url is up-to-date\").</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/1f25c2c0-1a9e-49af-8c81-26fb2bc3252c\" style=\"width: 410px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>The below dates are still unchanged and were communicated in previous updates:</p><ul><li>Entire O365 Connector service in Teams will retire in December 2025.</li><li>Developers will no longer be able to create new Office 365 Connectors from the Developer Portal starting August 15th, 2024.</li></ul><p>Additional documentation:</p><p><a href=\"https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/office/create-incoming-webhooks-with-workflows-for-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498\" target=\"_blank\">Create incoming webhooks with Workflows for Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Support</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/browse-and-add-workflows-in-microsoft-teams-4998095c-8b72-4b0e-984c-f2ad39e6ba9a#:~:text=Workflows%20let%20you%20automate%20repetitive%20tasks%20or%20processes\" target=\"_blank\">Browse and add workflows in Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Support</a></p><p><b>Note about parity features for the Workflows app</b></p><p>We are currently developing a method for webhooks in the Workflow app to support the following scenarios and will share more details before March 30, 2025.</p><ul><li>Post messageCard formatted message payloads (so you do not have to reformat the payload to adaptive card)</li><li>Post to private channels</li></ul>",

Device admins will now have the ability to manage these operations without affecting end-user experience, ensuring smoother and uninterrupted device usage.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=418120\" target=\"_blank\">418120</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out late February 2025 and expect to complete by early March 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This change will significantly enhance the user experience by ensuring that device operations such as software updates, restarts, and configuration updates are carried out only when the device is idle. This means meetings or calls will no longer be interrupted by these operations. This change will be applicable for Teams Rooms on Android, Panels, Phones, and Displays.\n</p><p>This change will require an update for Teams app and the Teams admin agent app to take effect. We will update this message closer to the release date with details about the required versions.\n</p><p>With this change, the following device operations will automatically function in a non-disruptive way:\n</p><ul><li>Software update\n</li><li>Device restart\n</li><li>Configuration update\n</li></ul><p>This change will be applicable for operations created by administrators manually from Teams admin center or the Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal, as well as those being carried out automatically.\n</p><p><u>How this will work:</u></p><p>At the time of execution, the device status is checked. The execution goes forward only if the device is free (no ongoing meeting or call) and has no upcoming scheduled event on the calendar.\n</p><p>A few minutes before the execution starts, the device shows a notification for the end-users, informing them that the operation is about to start. The device users get an option to Postpone the execution if they want to use the device.\n</p><p>The execution of the operation does not start if the device is busy, or has upcoming scheduled events on the calendar, or the end-user has opted to postpone the execution. The device status is checked at regular intervals for a safe window for execution.\n</p><p>The status of the operation is available in Teams admin center. Admins can view the details on the device page under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#manage-phones-teams-rooms-on-android-teams-displays-and-teams-panels\" target=\"_blank\">History tab</a>.\n</p><p>This ensures that the end-users do not face any disturbance while they are using Teams devices.\n</p><p><u style=\"\">Additional aspects</u>\n</p><p>There could be scenarios where the devices are extremely busy thus delaying the execution of the operation. Administrators will have an option to decide the execution approach if the execution is unable to start even after 24 hrs. There are two options:\n</p><ul><li>The operation is cancelled after having tried for 24 hrs<b>.</b> There will be no impact on the device. If the administrator created this operation, they can come back can create it again. <u>This is the default behavior.\n</u></li><li>The operation is force-executed after having tried for 24 hrs. This option will execute the operation, but the status of the device will not be checked at this point. This may cause some disruption if the device is in use.\n</li></ul><p>The option to cancel or force the execution of the operations after the 24-hr search of a safe-execution window can be configured from Teams admin center through the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#use-configuration-profiles-in-teams\" target=\"_blank\" );\"=\"\">Configuration profiles</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>The changes will take effect automatically after updating the devices to the required Teams app and Teams admin agent versions. The updates will happen automatically, but admins can choose to update manually also. The details about the required versions will be announced closer to the release date. Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/remote-update\" target=\"_blank\">Update Microsoft Teams devices remotely - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a> for more details about updating devices.\n</p><p>Admins should familiarize themselves with the new controls available in the Teams admin center. They should ensure that they configure the settings appropriately to suit their organization's needs. Additionally, it's recommended to communicate these changes to end-users, so they are aware of the improved experience and new notifications they might receive regarding device operations.\n</p><p>We believe this feature will greatly improve the reliability and user experience of Teams devices in your organization.\n</p><p>For any clarification, feel free to reach out to Microsoft Support.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

If you are currently following this guidance,<b> this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</b></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

To set up bookable desks, admins must associate these devices to a workspace account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Similarly, to set up <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bring-your-own-device\" target=\"_blank\">BYOD rooms</a> (rooms without Microsoft Teams Rooms that are equipped with devices such as a speaker puck or other peripherals), admins must associate these devices to a room account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Finally, in order for a user’s work location to be updated to a specific building, an admin must onboard their buildings<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/places/get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors?branch=main\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>and parent the workspace or room resource account to the buildings.</p><p>After these steps are complete, admins have the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsworklocationdetectionpolicy?view=teams-ps\" target=\"_blank\">option to opt-in</a> for automatic location updates. This can be enabled at a tenant level or for a specific user group. Once admins have enabled this feature, users will have the opportunity to opt-in. They can do so in Teams under <i>Settings &gt; Privacy</i>. After users have opted-in, their work location will automatically update to a specific building when they connect to a bookable desk or BYOD room. Note that if a workspace or room resource account does not have a building, the user's work location will automatically update to “In the office” upon plug-in rather than update to the specific building</p><p>To facilitate discovery of this feature, after tenant opt-in, the following banner will be shown the first time a user plugs into a bookable desk or BYOD room.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/be3a63d0-1058-4050-8164-a97cfc72fb47\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><br></p><p>Once a user enables automatic location updates, the following banner will be displayed only once for the user’s convenience and confirmation that the location update was successful on their first subsequent plug-in to bookable desks or BYOD room.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f79a81e-12b8-40bf-a935-c730b7c0c832\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this feature, we strongly recommend communicating this new feature to your users and admin team and sharing instructions if needed. Please note that if an admin or user had previously opted in when the automatic work location detection only updated to “In the office” (MC808158), there is no additional setting to enable for one’s work location be automatically updated with building information.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview: We are excited to announce upcoming enhancements to Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP). With the forthcoming update, the capability to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows endpoint devices will be significantly expanded. The number of supported file types will increase from approximately 40 to over 100, aligning endpoint coverage with other platforms like Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. Additionally, this update will introduce several key enhancements, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Detection of labels from protected files (pfiles).\n</li><li>Identification of sensitive content within file metadata.\n</li><li>Recognition of sensitive information in PDF form fields.</li><li>Detection of sensitive information in files embedded inside office files (for example, a .txt file inside .pptx file)</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=171586\" target=\"_blank\">171586</a></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June (previously late July) 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously late mid-February.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The upcoming update will enhance DLP's content scanning on Windows devices. No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles). This means that it can now read labels not just from Office and PDF files, but all other files where MIP label with protection can be applied via applications like AIP client, Secude etc. which converts the file into “pfile”.</p><p>Picture 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8c4d2426-7164-4710-900b-2bd8667b59ca\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>A txt file converted to .ptxt (PFile) after applying a label. This label can now be detected with this preview.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\tScanning metadata\n</p>\n\n<p>Ability to detect sensitive content in file metadata like custom properties in Office and PDF files.</p><p>Picture 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/22b5d8fe-a5ef-4d5e-b810-a74f9ea7dc49\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>4.\tScanning content embedded in Microsoft 365 office files\n</p>\n\n<p>If a file is embedded inside an office file (Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint), the content of the embedded file is also scanned. For example, if a DOCX file containing credit card numbers is inserted into an XLSX file, the content of both XLSX and the embedded DOCX files will be scanned, and credit card numbers will be detected.\n</p><p>Picture 3:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/cab0da75-319b-40bc-967f-b8c6766611e7\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>5.\tBetter scanning with PDF files\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in PDF forms.\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in permission protected PDF files. Permission protected PDF files are ones which do not require any password to open the file and read the content but require a password to edit/copy the content.\n</p>\n\n<p>Picture 4:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/453bd3df-d597-4e9d-ab89-43f90a87f4f8\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>You do not need do any changes to your existing policies.

This simplifies labeling in bulk across document libraries in an organization. This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library. Changes to user permissions on the document library are reflected on downloaded files, including full revocation for users removed from the document library. This provides a more streamlined way to revoke access to documents for individual users (instead of revoking access to each document).\n</p><p>Learn more about how to use this feature and its capabilities, limitations, and licensing: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-extend-permissions\" target=\"_blank\">Configure SharePoint with a sensitivity label to extend permissions to downloaded documents | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>After this feature is available, we recommend you test this feature first on sites with non-production data to understand its capabilities.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

At that time, administrators will be able to self-initiate the migration using the wizard. The automatic migration for customers with only a global permission policy (Phase 1) and those with multiple permission policies (Phase 3) will be postponed until early 2025. Further updates, including the details for Phase 3 auto-migration, will be provided in a future MC post update and public documentation.</p><p style=\"\">App centric management (ACM) is on hold    as of August 14, 2024, and will restart in mid-October (previously mid-September).

The rest of this MC post is not applicable to your tenant.\n</li><li>If your tenant fell under the Phase 1 criteria of using only the Global app permission policy and no custom app permission policies, it will resume auto migration in mid-September.\n</li><li>If you do not have a draft currently saved, you will not be able to access ACM migration until the roll out restarts.<br></li></ul><p style=\"\">What is in Phase 2?\n</p><ul><li>Migration wizard: a step-by-step guide to help you migrate the permission policies. You will be able to select which polities to migrate and designate users groups or individuals who should have access to the apps.\n</li><li>Testing and Validation: before finalizing the migration, you will have the opportunity to test and export your staged changes. You can use this to make side-by-side comparison with your current setup, ensuring everything is perfect before you proceed.\n</li><li>Duration: The migration process is designed to have no downtime for the end users and can take a few hours to complete.

First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to the Teams app store. Second, admins can manage apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.

The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) in September 2025. After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be making this change in September 2025.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In September 2024, we will update the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. In January 2025, we will send a Message Center post to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change. In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>As communicated in MC711020 <i>Outlook: Outlook for web – new application ID</i> (January 2024), Microsoft Outlook for the web is undergoing an authentication platform migration to a public client authentication model using <a href=\"https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js#microsoft-authentication-library-for-javascript-msaljs\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library)</a>. The change to client-side authentication will be subject to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/blog/cookie-countdown-2023oct\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Google's third-party cookie block</a> that may be active in Chrome and Edge.<br></p><p>Google's third-party cookie block impacts navigation to Microsoft Entra ID to perform silent single sign-on (SSO). To overcome this block, Outlook for the web will present a banner for the user to refresh their session. This will enable navigation to Entra ID to refresh their token. SSO-enabled Windows devices are expected to silently sign in users with SSO without requiring further interaction and will not display the banner. This issue affects Outlook for web users. It will not affect users of new Outlook for Windows, Outlook (classic), Outlook for Mac, Outlook Mobile for iOS and Outlook Mobile for Android.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late November 2024 (previously late September) and expect to complete by late January 2025 (previously late December).</p><p>General Availability (GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late December 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by late February 2024 (previously late December).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this migration: Outlook for the web users were not affected by the third-party cookie block in Chrome and Edge and were able to stay signed in unless they signed out or were signed out due to inactivity.\n</p><p>After Outlook for the web migrates to MSAL, Outlook for the web users without device SSO who are using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge and who have third-party cookie blocking enabled will start seeing the following if Outlook for the web is not able to silently sign in the user with SSO:\n</p><ul><li>Outlook for the web will display a red banner below the ribbon and require users to sign in when a session is open for more than 24 hours.\n</li><li>Windowed (deep linked) Mail items and Calendar events will display a blocking dialog requesting users to return to Outlook for the web to sign in when the deep-linked item token expires.\n</li><li>Independent of Outlook for the web's migration to MSAL, Outlook for the web may include embedded experiences such as apps that may stop functioning due to the third-party cookie block. If this happens, the app may provide an app-specific experience to refresh their token. Alternatively, the user may be able to right-click the app to launch the app in a browser or can choose to refresh the entire Outlook for the web session.</li></ul><p>Sign-in error message in red banner below the ribbon in Outlook for the web: \"You need to sign in.

Very large tenants will take longer.  While the index is provisioning, search requests will only return shared and public content.  Once the new index is complete, private and shared content will be returned.  If no additional search requests for private content are sent within 100 days, the private index will be decommissioned.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Video files tend to be very large and consume lots of space against your Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint storage quotas. Currently, when you make metadata changes such as title, description, transcripts, chapters, interactivity, thumbnails, media settings, etc. to files in Microsoft Stream, each of those changes cause new versions to be created. Each of these versions in Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint count the full file size towards consumed storage quota. Thus, for large video and audio files, these versions cause your storage consumption to quickly increase.<br></p><p>To prevent this, we are changing how Microsoft Stream handles versioning. Any changes made specifically to chapters and transcripts of files from Stream will stop making versions, thus preventing storage from increasing as rapidly as it has in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395380\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">395380</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete by late August 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Changes to video and audio files from Stream will no longer take version snapshots.

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

If you are currently following this guidance, this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook.

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 11, 2024: We have updated the content to reflect the change to Viva Engage. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is strongly recommended that you back up your data and communicate the migration to your users prior to your scheduled migration start date. If your alignment report reveals any blockers to migration, you can log an exception with support.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule your migration around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.</p><p><br></p>",

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",
