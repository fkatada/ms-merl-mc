Device admins will now have the ability to manage these operations without affecting end-user experience, ensuring smoother and uninterrupted device usage.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=418120\" target=\"_blank\">418120</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out late February 2025 and expect to complete by early March 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This change will significantly enhance the user experience by ensuring that device operations such as software updates, restarts, and configuration updates are carried out only when the device is idle. This means meetings or calls will no longer be interrupted by these operations. This change will be applicable for Teams Rooms on Android, Panels, Phones, and Displays.\n</p><p>This change will require an update for Teams app and the Teams admin agent app to take effect. We will update this message closer to the release date with details about the required versions.\n</p><p>With this change, the following device operations will automatically function in a non-disruptive way:\n</p><ul><li>Software update\n</li><li>Device restart\n</li><li>Configuration update\n</li></ul><p>This change will be applicable for operations created by administrators manually from Teams admin center or the Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal, as well as those being carried out automatically.\n</p><p><u>How this will work:</u></p><p>At the time of execution, the device status is checked. The execution goes forward only if the device is free (no ongoing meeting or call) and has no upcoming scheduled event on the calendar.\n</p><p>A few minutes before the execution starts, the device shows a notification for the end-users, informing them that the operation is about to start.

The device status is checked at regular intervals for a safe window for execution.\n</p><p>The status of the operation is available in Teams admin center. Admins can view the details on the device page under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#manage-phones-teams-rooms-on-android-teams-displays-and-teams-panels\" target=\"_blank\">History tab</a>.\n</p><p>This ensures that the end-users do not face any disturbance while they are using Teams devices.\n</p><p><u style=\"\">Additional aspects</u>\n</p><p>There could be scenarios where the devices are extremely busy thus delaying the execution of the operation. Administrators will have an option to decide the execution approach if the execution is unable to start even after 24 hrs. There are two options:\n</p><ul><li>The operation is cancelled after having tried for 24 hrs<b>.</b> There will be no impact on the device. If the administrator created this operation, they can come back can create it again. <u>This is the default behavior.\n</u></li><li>The operation is force-executed after having tried for 24 hrs. This option will execute the operation, but the status of the device will not be checked at this point. This may cause some disruption if the device is in use.\n</li></ul><p>The option to cancel or force the execution of the operations after the 24-hr search of a safe-execution window can be configured from Teams admin center through the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#use-configuration-profiles-in-teams\" target=\"_blank\" );\"=\"\">Configuration profiles</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>The changes will take effect automatically after updating the devices to the required Teams app and Teams admin agent versions. The updates will happen automatically, but admins can choose to update manually also. The details about the required versions will be announced closer to the release date. Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/remote-update\" target=\"_blank\">Update Microsoft Teams devices remotely - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a> for more details about updating devices.\n</p><p>Admins should familiarize themselves with the new controls available in the Teams admin center. They should ensure that they configure the settings appropriately to suit their organization's needs. Additionally, it's recommended to communicate these changes to end-users, so they are aware of the improved experience and new notifications they might receive regarding device operations.\n</p><p>We believe this feature will greatly improve the reliability and user experience of Teams devices in your organization.\n</p><p>For any clarification, feel free to reach out to Microsoft Support.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

As communicated in MC814577 <i>(Updated) Microsoft Teams: Roster grouping for in-room participants through Proximity Join for Teams Rooms on Windows</i> (July 2024), we will launch this same experience in September 2024 for joining a nearby meeting with a Microsoft Teams Room and a companion device.<br></p><p>Unique to BYOD meeting rooms, the roster group will be displayed as <i>Meeting space</i> if the connected device is NOT identified in the Teams Pro Management Portal (PMP).

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported.

We'll have a more detailed update later.</p><p>In today’s security climate, our work across the company and greater industry to keep this critical ecosystem secure is more important than ever. And while we also ship bug fixes and other new features via continuous innovation, in the end security is job one.\n</p><p>Keeping Microsoft Teams up to date is critical to ensure your devices are secure and compliant.  By default, and as designed, Teams updates automatically which successfully updates most clients in the world without additional overhead for customers. \n</p><p>Microsoft Teams is governed by the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a> which requires that the Teams desktop client be kept up to date.  This is not a new policy, for instance in MC298823 (November 2021), a version that is far out of date will become incompatible with the service until it’s updated.  As <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">documented</a>, when a client falls out of date, the user will see:\n</p><ul><li>Recurring in-app alerts, if the app is between 30d-90d out of date.\n</li><li>A blocking page in Teams, if the app is greater than 90 days out of date.  At this point, the app will show options to update, to contact their IT administrator, or continue to Teams on the web.  \n</li></ul><p>As an example, if the Teams app is hypothetically on a version released on January 1 and the next update is fully available on January 15, an in-app alert would be shown on February 14th (30 days after the January 15th update).  \n</p><p>For reference, link to the Teams app's  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/teams-app-versioning\" target=\"_blank\">version's release dates</a>.  Also, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-usage-report\" target=\"_blank\">The Microsoft Teams desktop client usage report</a> gives you an overview of the Teams desktop clients in use within your organization.\n</p><p>Classic Teams is not in scope for this post; see MC783985 for Classic Teams Timelines regarding end of support and end of availability.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>The existing policy enforcement will be visible beginning November 12th, 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>New Teams - Windows &amp; Mac Versions desktop clients (not running in a VDI environment) \n</p><ul><li>Beginning November 12th, 2024, Teams desktop clients &gt;30d out of date, will present a banner or notification to users that they are on an outdated version of Teams.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-December 2024 (previously July 2024) and expect to complete mid-January 2025 (previously late November 2024). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

To set up bookable desks, admins must associate these devices to a workspace account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Similarly, to set up <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bring-your-own-device\" target=\"_blank\">BYOD rooms</a> (rooms without Microsoft Teams Rooms that are equipped with devices such as a speaker puck or other peripherals), admins must associate these devices to a room account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Finally, in order for a user’s work location to be updated to a specific building, an admin must onboard their buildings<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/places/get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors?branch=main\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>and parent the workspace or room resource account to the buildings.</p><p>After these steps are complete, admins have the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsworklocationdetectionpolicy?view=teams-ps\" target=\"_blank\">option to opt-in</a> for automatic location updates. This can be enabled at a tenant level or for a specific user group. Once admins have enabled this feature, users will have the opportunity to opt-in. They can do so in Teams under <i>Settings &gt; Privacy</i>. After users have opted-in, their work location will automatically update to a specific building when they connect to a bookable desk or BYOD room. Note that if a workspace or room resource account does not have a building, the user's work location will automatically update to “In the office” upon plug-in rather than update to the specific building</p><p>To facilitate discovery of this feature, after tenant opt-in, the following banner will be shown the first time a user plugs into a bookable desk or BYOD room.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qrTr?ver=f226\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><br></p><p>Once a user enables automatic location updates, the following banner will be displayed only once for the user’s convenience and confirmation that the location update was successful on their first subsequent plug-in to bookable desks or BYOD room.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qiPN?ver=00da\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this feature, we strongly recommend communicating this new feature to your users and admin team and sharing instructions if needed. Please note that if an admin or user had previously opted in when the automatic work location detection only updated to “In the office” (MC808158), there is no additional setting to enable for one’s work location be automatically updated with building information. The same setting will carry over.</p><p>For more information about sharing location, visit<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/user-work-location-in-teams#user-settings-to-edit-location-sharing\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;User experience with location details in Teams</a>.</p><p></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview: We are excited to announce upcoming enhancements to Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP). With the forthcoming update, the capability to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows endpoint devices will be significantly expanded. The number of supported file types will increase from approximately 40 to over 100, aligning endpoint coverage with other platforms like Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. Additionally, this update will introduce several key enhancements, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Detection of labels from protected files (pfiles).\n</li><li>Identification of sensitive content within file metadata.\n</li><li>Recognition of sensitive information in PDF form fields.</li><li>Detection of sensitive information in files embedded inside office files (for example, a .txt file inside .pptx file)</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=171586\" target=\"_blank\">171586</a></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June (previously late July) 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously late mid-February.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The upcoming update will enhance DLP's content scanning on Windows devices. No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles).

Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the document library. Changes to user permissions on the document library are reflected on downloaded files, including full revocation for users removed from the document library.

We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. The External Recipient Rate Limit will only apply to WWMT/Production.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in January 2025, Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

To provide a consistent experience we are making changes to allow Teams contacts, created with a user's&nbsp;Entra ID (AAD) account, to be visible in Outlook as well.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Upcoming changes to contacts in Teams and Outlook:</b></p><p>Currently, Teams and Outlook maintain separate contact lists for enterprise users. Based on your feedback, we plan to introduce a unified contact experience, ensuring a consistent contacts experience across Outlook and Teams. In future, changes to contacts in users’ organization (Entra ID) account in Teams will reflect in Outlook and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>What's Happened so far:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We have completed one round of migration of all Teams contacts to Outlook in January 2024.&nbsp;</li><li>As a result, users may see more contacts in Outlook, namely those created in Teams and potentially Skype for Business contacts (if enabled).&nbsp;</li><li>Existing Outlook contacts may also be enriched with additional details from corresponding Teams contacts.&nbsp;</li><li>Teams users can see Outlook contacts but cannot edit them inside Teams.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>What's Coming:</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Users will gradually upgrade to the new unified experience from December 2024. The new experience will be enabled for each user across all endpoints (Desktop, Mobile, Devices etc.) simultaneously. Once the new experience is enabled for a user, they will see same set of contacts in Outlook and Teams. Any change in Outlook will reflect in Teams and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>All Teams contact changes (creations and edits) made since January will be included in the unified store.

After this rollout, this subfield will have a new fallback to enhance capabilities.\n</li><li><code>APIId</code>: Used to uniquely identify an API endpoint or service.

      "Content": "<p>Updated November 7, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Soon, on Windows and macOS devices running the OneDrive sync app, we will enable a new feature called “Offline mode” that will allow you to continue working with the OneDrive web app in your browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) or Microsoft Teams even when you are offline. This feature will be on by default and will give your users the ability to view, rename, move, copy their files, and create new folders when offline. Users will be able to open their files that are available offline on users’ device in a native app directly from inside OneDrive on the web. All of the metadata changes users make offline to their files in the browser will be automatically synced back to OneDrive when Internet connection is restored, and users can resolve conflicts, if there are any. As an administrator, you’ll be able to control various aspects of Offline mode using the Group Policies outlined in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time. A copy of user’s file metadata that powers OneDrive for web is securely stored locally on user’s device. These data on user’s device are only available and accessible by that user. If someone else were to sign in on your device, these local data on the device wouldn't be available to them.<br></p><p>A secure local web server on user’s device will handle the operations that users perform on their files in OneDrive for web, such as viewing, sorting, renaming, moving, and copying where traditionally these operations would need to be handled by the OneDrive cloud service. This allows to eliminate network as the bottleneck when loading and working with OneDrive for web resulting in fast and smooth interactions with users’ files like loading your files and folders, sorting, renaming, moving, renaming, and more. And all of these operations will continue to work even when users are offline, lose internet connection, or run into a service disruption.<br></p><ul><li>OneDrive Offline mode lets you work on OneDrive when offline in the browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) and in Microsoft Teams, improves performance on all kinds of networks, and helps alleviate throttling related to working with large file collections.</li><li>OneDrive Offline mode is currently supported on Windows devices (Windows 10 or later) and macOS devices (macOS 12 Monterey or later) that have the OneDrive sync app installed and on Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome)<br></li><li>Offline mode will be on by default for user’s OneDrive on the web and both users and administrators will have the option to disable Offline mode for their OneDrive.<br></li><li>Offline mode is a per-device setting (configured separately for every device users use to access OneDrive on the web.<br></li><li>The data is securely stored in a local database under the user’s profile directory and requests are handled through a secure localhost HTTP server. Offline mode is powered by a separate background process (Microsoft.SharePoint.exe).<br></li><li>When Offline mode is on, users will see a new icon in the top navigation bar in OneDrive on the web.<br></li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=168618\" target=\"_blank\">168618</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Worldwide: We will begin gradually rolling out in late February 2024 (previously mid-February) and expect to complete in late November 2024 (previously late October).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b><br></p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time. A copy of user’s file metadata that powers OneDrive for web will be downloaded and securely stored locally on user’s device. The actual contents of users’ files will not be downloaded. After Offline mode is set up, only changes to users’ file metadata will result in upload or download activity over the network. Users can continue working with OneDrive on the web as before and they can choose to turn off Offline mode if they desire to do so.

Version history allows users to see when and who made changes to a file and provides the ability to restore to a previous version of the file within the Office app. If there are conflicts within a file that does not require user input, Office will merge the conflicts and ensure that the Office file is up to date with the latest changes. If user input is required to merge conflicts, Office will show the merge conflicts and prompt the user to choose which edits to prioritize.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change, especially if the policy is disabled, educate them about autosave, real time user collab, and merging in the case of M365 application conflicts, and update any relevant documentation.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy#allow-users-to-choose-how-to-handle-office-file-sync-conflicts\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Allow users to choose how to handle Office file sync conflicts</a>.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Public Preview / Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-November 2024 and expect to complete by mid-November 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out  late January 2025 and expect to complete by early February 2025.</p><p>General Availability (GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, users have separate <i>Chat </i>and <i>Teams </i>views (apps) with no option to unify these views; custom sections of chats and channels were not possible; and there was no view for collecting all personal mentions in one list across chats and channels.\n</p><p>The new experience brings chat, teams, and channels into one place, in <i>Chat</i>, so users can easily navigate between all conversations without switching between contexts. Users start in the combined <i>Chat </i>view but can opt to keep chat separate from teams and channels like before.\n</p><p>In the Chat view, users will see these sections (in order):\n</p><ol><li><i>Favorites </i>containing any previously pinned chats and channels\n</li><li><i>Chats </i>sorted by most recent\n</li><li><i>Teams and channels</i>, organized in same order as in the <i>Teams </i>view\n</li></ol><p>Also, users can create custom sections to organize projects and topics that can include individual, group, and meeting chats, as well as channels. \n</p><p><i>Favorites, Chats, </i>and <i>Teams and channels </i>in one list in Teams for Windows: \n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qdz3?ver=aa52\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><i>Favorites, Chats, </i>and <i>Teams </i>and <i>channels </i>in one list in Teams for iOS (also available for Android):\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qiPQ?ver=c363\" style=\"width: 250px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>New filters for <i>Unread, Chat, Channels, Meetings</i> and more help users focus on relevant conversation in their list. Filters persist until turned off.\n</p><p>The new @mention view gathers all personal @mentions into one interactive list. Users can quickly access messages with @mentions across chats, channels, and meetings.\n</p><p><i>Customizing the experience</i>\n</p><p>Users can tailor their chat and channels experience in Teams <i>Settings</i>. Users can choose to keep chat, teams, and channels combined in <i>Chat </i>(default) or switch to separate <i>Chat </i>and <i>Teams </i>views. In the combined <i>Chat </i>view, message previews are off by default to simplify the list. Users can turn on message previews in <i>Settings</i>.\n</p><p>When using the separate <i>Chat</i> and <i>Teams </i>views, users can still use the new filters and the @mentions view to triage and organize topics with custom sections.</p><p>\n</p><p><i>Starting the new experience</i>\n</p><p>A self-service guided onboarding flow in Teams will help users discover the new experience and configure it to their preferences. Users who prefer to keep chat and channels separate can easily do so during the onboarding process or later, without IT assistance. \n</p><p>When the new experience is available in your tenant, this screen will display to users:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qg5W?ver=bbc1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user notification\">\n</p><p>The Get started button will take users to the new combined chat, teams, and channels experience in Chat, and highlight the location of settings. Users will have the option to defer the new experience up to three times over the course of approximately three days, providing flexibility while also moving an organization to the new experience overall.\n</p><p>This feature is on by default. The new experience has no admin policy. Each user can make choices to optimize for how they work best.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization.

Starting early November 2024, Copilot Pages will become available for Microsoft Copilot users when signed in with an Entra account. This feature was previously only available for users with a paid Microsoft 365 Copilot license. Pages will be enabled by default and admin controls are available should you need to control the experience differently within your tenant.<br></p><p>Note: In September 2024, Pages started to roll out for Microsoft 365 Copilot users in Work mode of Business Chat (MC890882). This update will also roll out Pages to Web mode in Business Chat for Microsoft 365 Copilot users.\n</p><p>Note: Copilot Pages will only be available in Microsoft Copilot for users signed in with an Entra account who have an underlying SharePoint license. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out Copilot Pages in early November 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Recently, we <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/copilot-for-microsoft-365/copilot-chat-available-in-business-chat/ba-p/4242701\" target=\"_blank\">announced Copilot Pages</a>, a first step in our new design system for knowledge work. Copilot Pages is a dynamic, persistent canvas in Copilot chat designed for multi-player collaboration. With Copilot Pages, you can turn insightful Copilot responses into something durable with a side-by-side page that you can view and edit and, when ready, share with your team to collaborate. \n</p><p>In a multiplayer approach, you can work together as a team to learn from each other’s prompts, and organize complex information. We see collaboration using Copilot Pages as the next great step forward in evolving Copilot from an individual, point-in-time exercise into a collaborative experience. \n</p><p>You can return to a page at any time by clicking the link in chat or the Open Page icon at the top of the associated Copilot session. Additionally, users can view all their pages in the Pages module in Microsoft365.com where they can also collaborate with others. \n</p><p>Created pages are stored in a user-owned SharePoint Embedded container. The container is lifetime-managed with the user account, so like OneDrive, the container and its content are deleted when the user account is deleted.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>The feature will be automatically enabled when it rolls out unless you’ve used the following controls to manage the experience. If you wish to change the configuration of the feature, there are two ways to consider based on your needs.\n</p><p>You can use a Cloud Policy setting to prevent users from creating new Copilot pages in Microsoft Copilot, and/or use Conditional Access or Information Barriers policies to block certain users from accessing Copilot pages as needed.\n</p><p>Note: The controls for Copilot pages are the same for both free Microsoft Copilot (when signed in with an Entra account) and the paid Microsoft 365 Copilot license.\n</p><p>More information can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-copilot/copilot-pages-for-it-admins-sep-2024-update/ba-p/4241521\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot pages for IT Admins - Sep 2024 update</a>\n</p><p>Instructions for using the Cloud Policy to enable/disable Copilot pages in your tenant repeated here for ready reference:\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to <a href=\"https://config.office.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://config.office.com/</a>&nbsp;with your Microsoft 365 admin credentials.\n</li><li>Select <b>Customization </b>from the left pane.\n</li><li>Select <b>Policy Management</b>.\n</li><li>Create a new policy configuration or edit an existing one.\n</li><li>From the <b>Choose the scope </b>dropdown list, choose either <b>All users </b>or select the group for which you want to apply the policy.

Previously, meetings with only transcription enabled saved the transcript file to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online, while meetings with both recording and transcription enabled saved two transcript copies—one that is coupled with the recording saved to OneDrive and another transcript copy saved to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p>Now with this feature, meetings that have only transcription enabled will also save two copies (one in OneDrive and one in Exchange Online), but all meeting transcript entry points in Teams app will point to the OneDrive copy only, no entry points for meeting transcripts will source from the Exchange Online copy. <i>At the same time</i>, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive only.&nbsp;</p><p>The rollout of this feature also improves both the experience of meeting organizers to manually delete the transcript, as well as the ability for IT administrators to apply retention policies to the transcripts from meetings that only had transcription enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the deletion experience for meeting transcripts is captured in the following table:&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th>User</th>\n    <th>Type of transcript deletion</th>\n    <th>Previous experience</th>\n<th>New Experience with this feature rollout</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer </th>\n    <td>Manually from Teams app</td>\n    <td>Only deleted Exchange Online transcript file</td>\n<td>Deletes both copies of the transcript file from OneDrive and Exchange Online</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer</th>\n    <td>Manually from Stream</td>\n    <td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n<td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>IT Administrator</th>\n    <td>Retention policies in Teams Admin Center</td>\n    <td>Only available for copies saved in OneDrive, so only applicable to meetings with recording turned on.</td>\n<td><p>Now the retention policy is also applicable to meetings with only transcription enabled and to the transcript file saved in OneDrive.</p><p> \n \nTo bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> \n\n</p></td>\n  </tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=365720\" target=\"_blank\">365720</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b> \n</p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously mid-August).\n</p><p>GCC High: We will begin rolling out late August 2024 and expect to complete by mid-September 2024.\n</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out late September 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously mid-October).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>There is no change to the end user experience for viewing and downloading Teams meeting transcripts. The only change for meeting organizers and co-organizers is for any meetings that are held after this feature rolls out, they can delete all copies of the meeting transcript directly from the Teams app, instead of having to manually delete all copies of the transcript from two places (Teams app and Stream). For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled. This retention policy won’t affect the copies saved in Exchange Online, to bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to this <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.</p><p>We will also update the default transcript permissions. After the rollout, when the new policy is not applied, only meeting organizers and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, and meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams or Microsoft Stream. Regardless of whether the new policy is applied, the meeting organizer will be able to select in Stream the participants who are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript in Stream.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>  \n</p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) in September 2025. After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks.

In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

As a result, Office add-ins or Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers that rely on unsigned or ad-hoc-signed dynamic libraries don't work as intended.</p><p>However, most dynamic libraries used with Office apps are already codesigned, so this change is unlikely to affect most users.</p><p>In this message, when non-Microsoft products is mentioned, it specifically refers to products and applications that enhance or extend Office functionality (like add-ins or integrations). This doesn't include all non-Microsoft software installed on your device.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>This change is expected to be live in production in mid-November 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>Reason for the change:</p><p>Microsoft requires executable code from non-Microsoft products be codesigned with a valid&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/developer-id/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Developer ID</a>. This requirement ensures that only verified and properly signed code runs within Office applications, promoting code integrity and compliance with macOS development standards.</p><p>Workflow changes for users:</p><p>If your workflow uses unsigned dynamic libraries within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint for macOS, it no longer works as intended. You need to get an updated version of the product from the original software developer.</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Actions required for developers:</p><p>If your product uses dynamic libraries, make sure they're codesigned with an Apple Developer ID. Unsigned or ad-hoc-signed libraries are no longer allowed to load into Office app processes. For more information on the Apple Developer program and tools, see the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Developer Program</a>. Office applications support libraries codesigned for distribution through any Apple-supported distribution mechanism, including direct download by your customers.</p><p>Steps for admins:</p><ul><li>Verify Deployed non-Microsoft Products: Check if you have any non-Microsoft products deployed to your users. These products often:<ul><li>Extend Office functionality by adding menu or ribbon controls.\n</li><li>Communicate with other applications to share content with Office.\n</li><li>Support external data connections such as ODBC.\n</li></ul></li><li>Confirm codesigning compliance: Make sure that any non-Microsoft products follow best practices and codesigned any dynamic libraries included in their products. If any libraries aren't codesigned, contact the product developer for updates.</li><li>Monitor system logs: Inspect the system console logs for Library Load Constraint Rejection messages. These messages from macOS identify any dynamic library that the OS rejects from loading into an Office app process.</li><li>Consider proactively blocking all non-Microsoft libraries: To block these libraries, set the Office preference DisableVisualBasicExternalDylibs to true using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/welcome/web\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Platform Deployment guide</a>.\n</li></ul><p>Warning: Blocking all non-Microsoft libraries from running within Visual Basic macros is a significant action and should only be considered if absolutely necessary for your organization's requirements on macOS computers.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Starting October 16, 2024, we're gradually enabling IPv6 for all customer Accepted Domains that use Exchange Online for inbound mail. Microsoft is modernizing Exchange Online so our customers can easily meet their local regulations as well as benefit from the enhanced security and performance offered by IPv6.<br></p><p>More information on IPv6 support for Microsoft 365 services can be found at: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/ipv6-support?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">IPv6 support in Microsoft 365 services</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 16, 2024 (previously October 1, 2024)</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After we enable IPv6 for your Accepted Domains, when someone tries to send an email to one of your users and queries the MX record for the domain, they will receive both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (AAAA records) in response to their MX record query.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To take advantage of IPv6 connectivity, please make sure that you and your partner's update network allow-lists to allow Exchange Online IPv6 endpoints in the same way it allow-lists IPv4.\n</p><p>The Exchange Online IPv6 endpoints can be found here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges</a>.\n</p><p>To opt a domain out of inbound IPv6 so traffic flowing to the domain remains IPv4-only,  please use <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/disable-ipv6foraccepteddomain?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain -Domain for each domain you want to opt out of IPv6 (Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn)</a>.\n</p><p>IPv6 enablement may impact the source IP type used by Senders when connecting to Exchange Online, as the source and destination IP versions must match. For any IP Address-based Inbound connectors in Exchange Online that are referencing IPv4 addresses, you need to either:\n</p><ul><li>Keep the sending server as IPv4.\n<ul><li>Coordinate with the Sender so the Sender keeps connecting to your domain(s) via IPv4 or Opt your domain(s) out of IPv6\n</li></ul></li><li>Change the IP based connector to certificate domain based connector.\n<ul><li>This applies to both OnPremises type (From: <i>Your organization's email server</i>, To: <i>Office 365</i>) and Partner Type connectors (From: <i>Partner organization</i>, To: <i>Office 365</i>).</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><ul></ul><p></p><p>Update: If you are using any Exchange Transport Rules or Data Loss Prevention policies which rely on the SenderIPRanges predicate, you need to opt out all your domains from IPv6.</p><p>You can manage IPv6 for your Exchange Online Accepted Domains using the commands Enable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain or Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain.\n</p><p>Currently, you can check the status of your Accepted Domains with the Get-IPv6StatusForAcceptedDomain command. While some customers have already enabled IPv6, most will see it as disabled until October 16th.\n</p><p>After October 16, once IPv6 is enabled for your tenant, if you haven't explicitly set the IPv6 status for your Accepted Domains, the Get-IPv6StatusForAcceptedDomain command will reflect the new default behavior (enabled). \n</p><p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> To ensure your preferred settings are applied, please use the Enable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain or Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain commands before October 16th, after which IPv6 will be enabled by default if you haven't explicitly set it.</p><p>If you have enabled DNSSEC for mail flow, you may have issues executing the Get-IPv6StatusForAcceptedDomain cmdlet for the DNSSEC-enabled domain. We are rolling out the fix now. Please ensure to run Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain to opt out of the IPv6 enablement if you need to opt a DNSSEC-enabled domain out of the IPv6 by default rollout. The IPv6 rollout will not affect DNSSEC-enabled domains until after Nov 18th.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

This specialized mailbox appears with your other mailbox folders in Outlook. After this rollout, if you have enabled <i>Mailbox archive</i> for your users, the <i>Online Archive</i> mailbox will appear in the folder list, which users can access by tapping their profile in the top left of their screen.\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> The <i>Online Archive</i> folder is different than the <i>Archive </i>folder.

This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Moving forward, users with work or school accounts will access Microsoft Copilot through the Microsoft 365 app. In addition, Microsoft Copilot will offer enterprise data protection (EDP) at no additional cost for all users signed in with an Entra account. This means that security, privacy, and compliance controls and commitments available for Microsoft 365 Copilot will extend to Microsoft Copilot prompts and responses.  \n</p><p><b>When will this happen?</b></p><p>The update to Microsoft Copilot to offer enterprise data protection is rolling out now—and is replacing the current Copilot in Windows experience. The shift to the Microsoft 365 app as the entry point for Microsoft Copilot is coming soon. Changes will be rolled out to managed PCs starting with the optional non-security preview release on September 24, 2024, and following with the monthly security update release on October 8 for all supported versions of Windows 11. These changes will be applied to Windows 10 PCs the month after.  \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization hasn’t enabled Copilot in Windows (in preview), your existing preferences will be respected. Neither the Microsoft Copilot app nor the Microsoft 365 app are pinned to the taskbar. \n</p><p>If you had previously activated Copilot in Windows (in preview) for your workforce, to provide the best Copilot experience for your employees moving forward, we won't automatically pin the Microsoft 365 app to the taskbar in Windows. Rather, we'll ensure that you have control over how you enable the Copilot experience within your organization. If you want your users to have uninterrupted access to Microsoft Copilot after the update, use the configuration options to pin the Microsoft 365 app to the taskbar as the Copilot in Windows (preview) icon will be removed from the taskbar as part of the update. \n</p><p>Users signing into new PCs with work or school accounts can access Microsoft Copilot using the Microsoft 365 app, which comes pre-installed with all Windows PCs.

Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1nwuw?ver=dea1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 90 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks.

If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete.

Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q4 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 90 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP will follow closer to the start of Preview.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 13, 2024: We have updated the timing of this change below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through January 1, 2025. You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook.

These users do not yet meet the necessary requirements for the update and need deliberate action from you to transition them. There could be one or multiple of these issues preventing them from receiving new Teams. Please review the list below and suggested mitigations to avoid any work stoppage for your users.

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 11, 2024: We have updated the content to reflect the change to Viva Engage. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is strongly recommended that you back up your data and communicate the migration to your users prior to your scheduled migration start date.

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

The first version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise without Office Telemetry Dashboard will be Version 2208, which is expected to be available first in Current Channel in the second half of August 2022.  \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you do not use Office Telemetry Dashboard, you can disregard this message.  \n</p><p>Components of the Office Telemetry Dashboard will no longer be available in Version 2208 or later including the Office Telemetry Agent, Office Telemetry Processor, and the dashboard itself.  \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> Office Telemetry Log is not being removed and will still be available on client devices running Windows.</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b><br></p><p>The first version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise without Office Telemetry Dashboard will be Version 2208. That version is expected to be available first in Current Channel in the second half of August 2022. \n</p><p>Version 2208 is expected to be available in Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel in January 2023. \n</p><p><b>Note:</b> Office Telemetry Dashboard is not being removed from existing perpetual versions of Office, such as Office Professional Plus 2019. If you are using a perpetual version of Office, Office Telemetry Dashboard will be supported as long as your version of Office is supported. Here are the end of support dates for perpetual versions of Office that include the Office Telemetry Dashboard: \n</p><ul><li>Microsoft Office 2013 – April 11, 2023 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2016 – October 14, 2025 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2019 – October 14, 2025 \n</li></ul><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b> </p><p>Once a device in your organization updates to Version 2208 or later of Microsoft 365 Apps, Office Telemetry Dashboard components will be either removed or become unsupported.</p><p>To access information about the COM and VSTO add-ins in your environment, you can use the inventory feature available in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center \n</p><p> <b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>As the devices update to Version 2208 or later, the Office Telemetry Dashboard and Office Telemetry Agent will be automatically uninstalled from the devices.</p><p>However, the Office Telemetry Processor will need to be manually removed from devices using your standard management tools as there will be no new data for it to process. Similarly, the rest of the infrastructure including the shared folder and the SQL Server for permanent storage of telemetry data will become obsolete and therefore can be removed.  \n</p>",
