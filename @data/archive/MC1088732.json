To enhance security capabilities such as Continuous Access Evaluation and IP-based conditional access enforcement, Microsoft is transitioning these devices to modern, secure authentication using Entra ID (AAD) based tokens.\n</p><p>These changes will impact how devices authenticate to Teams services. This update provides key dates, required versions, and important cautions—especially for tenants using Teams Displays.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Once your devices are updated to the app versions listed below, end users will see no change in their Teams experience, while admins will have enhanced security capabilities such as Continuous Access Evaluation and IP-based conditional access enforcement. These updates are required to maintain connectivity and support secure authentication.\n</p><p>Minimum required app versions for modern authentication:\n</p><ul><li>Teams Phones: 1449/1.0.94.2025020301\n</li><li>Teams Rooms on Android (MTRA): 1449/1.0.96.2025020302\n</li><li>Teams Panels: 1449/1.0.97.2025020502\n</li><li>Teams Displays: To be released\n</li></ul><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><ul><li>July 31, 2025: Devices on supported app versions will automatically switch to modern authentication.
