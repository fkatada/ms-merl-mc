Instead of the Feed, people in your organization will soon see a Microsoft SharePoint <i>News </i>experience in Viva Connections, for a fresh new look that simplifies the user experience.

Microsoft 365 Copilot licensed users will have an additional option to generate a Copilot summary of the top 10 (or fewer) items in a user's <i>News </i>feed. A Microsoft 365 Copilot license is required to use this summarization feature in the news feed.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early March 2025 and expect to complete by mid-March 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late March 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.\n</p><p><i>Due to the nature of rollout technology across various platforms, some users may see the new experience sooner than others or in one platform first before the others.</i>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Users will see recommended SharePoint <i>News </i>based on the sites they follow, frequently access, posts by people they work with, and other trending sites. As always, users will only see news they have appropriate permissions for, and if a news item is audience-targeted, the <i>News </i>feed will honor that and filter out news items. Boosted news and news from your organization's news sites will always be prioritized at the top of the <i>News </i>feed.\n</p><p>Users can like news items in their feed and save them for later. They will have an immersive news experience in Viva Connections, without leaving Teams to read new content for individual sites they follow.\n</p><p>This change will be on by default.\n</p><p>The new Feed experience in Viva Connections in Teams for desktop and the web:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/22b17231-19b4-4c11-ab8e-f782b13ea3bb\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>The new Feed experience in Viva Connections in Teams for iOS/Android:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/2f4efbbd-9491-4055-af77-cf1923eda608\" style=\"width: 310.994px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>The Copilot-powered summary experience available only in Teams for Windows desktop for Microsoft 365 Copilot licensed users:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e6b37788-0a00-4c43-be0d-32b76aaa76e4\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
