    "Content": "<p>Updated April 28, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In new Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web, the hover actions in the message list will be moved to the Sender/From column to be more space-efficient and minimize unnecessary mouse travel for users with their Reading Pane set to Hide or Bottom. The large width occupied by the DateTime Received column will thus be reduced. For all users, a one-time shortcut to change/set your hover actions will be provided.&nbsp;After the changes to the hover actions, the first action will be replaced by a quick button (gear button) to change/set your hover actions. After that button has been triggered once, it will disappear, and your hover action settings will kick in fully.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=429868\" target=\"_blank\">429868</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously early April) and expect to complete by late May 2025 (previously late April).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 (previously late April) and expect to complete by late June 2025 (previously late May).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>For new Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the web, hover actions in the message list will be moved to the Sender/From column to reduce the large width occupied by the DateTime Received column.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/337d34e9-ecc6-49b4-b21c-d37078bb4c28\" style=\"width: 450px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.
