Thank you for your patience.</p><p>When joining a meeting in Teams Room on Windows or Android with a companion device (laptop or mobile), in-room participants will be grouped under the room node. Participants must join through Proximity Join. This update includes additional UI elements to create visual clarity of the in-room participants who are together.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=400702\" target=\"_blank\">400702</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late September 2024 (previously mid-September) and expect to complete by mid-December 2024 (previously mid-November).</p><p>General Availability (GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-September 2024 and expect to complete rollout by late October 2024 (late September).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This update is available by default if the companion device has enabled the Bluetooth setting and the Teams Room device has any one of the following XML &lt;SkypeSettings&gt; configuration settings enabled:</p><ul><li>&lt;BluetoothAdvertisementEnabled&gt;true&lt;/BluetoothAdvertisementEnabled&gt;</li><li>&lt;UltrasoundAdvertisementEnabled&gt;true&lt;/UltrasoundAdvertisementEnabled&gt;</li><li>&lt;RoomQRcodeEnabled&gt;true&lt;/RoomQRcodeEnabled&gt;</li></ul><p>\nOn the roster, in-room participants will automatically be grouped under the room node. The two scenarios in which in-room participants can be ungrouped from the room node are:</p><ul><li>Raised hand: For raised hand, we continue to follow the sequential order of raised hands. Therefore, in-room participants who use their companion device to raise their hand will be broken up and ordered accordingly. </li><li>Role assignment: For changes in roles (Presenters/Attendees), in-room participants can be broken up and placed in the appropriate category on the roster.</li></ul><p>In both scenarios, the room information will be listed below the participant's name.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1mTXj?ver=93db\" style=\"width: 295px;\"><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
