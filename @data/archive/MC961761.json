IRM data is accessible via Microsoft Security Graph APIs, allowing for reading and updating alert or incident statuses. Permissions are set at the application level, without solution-specific scoping. Any existing apps pulling data from these APIs will also access IRM data. So, if you integrate XDR alerts into external ticketing systems, IRM alerts will show up, unless you specifically filter out the alerts.\n</p><p>IRM alerts will appear in Sentinel if your tenant has the Defender XDR connector enabled in Microsoft Sentinel.\n</p><p>In Defender XDR, IRM data is not pseudonymized to allow effective correlation of IRM alerts with alerts from other solutions within the platform, such as Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Cloud apps.\n</p><p>These changes will be available by default for admins to configure in IRM global settings.\n</p><p>Admins will be able to view Insider Risk Management alerts in Defender XDR:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/a7b53b37-df99-48fb-8497-5e9c87017b9a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>Harness the power of Advanced Hunting queries with two new tables that contain Insider Risk Management data: DataSecurityBehaviors and DataSecurityEvents.
