Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Teams: When users or admins configure Microsoft Edge as the browser to open web links in Teams, then links in Teams chat will be open in Edge, and Edge launches in the profile that matches the authenticated profile. Users will benefit from a seamless browsing experience that integrates their identity and user data across Microsoft apps.&amp;\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=414521\" target=\"_blank\">414521</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late October 2024 and expect to complete by late January 2025 (previously late November).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, users are asked to reauthenticate links in the browser, which slows down users.\n</p><p>By default, there are no changes.\n</p><p>By default, the feature will be on with setting <i>System default browser</i> and Teams links will open in the system's default browser. System default browser refers to the default browser specified on the user's Mac device.\n</p><p>Admins can control the settings and availability of this feature (and override user settings) by policy in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center:\n</p><ul><li>If this policy is enabled, admins can go to <i>Choose which browser opens web links</i> and select <i>Microsoft Edge</i>.\n</li><li>If this policy is disabled or not configured, web links will open in the system default browser.\n</li></ul><p>How admins update the policy in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/2ac6d507-0942-490b-b5da-3de8de8e90e8\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>After admins configure the policy to open links with Edge in Teams, this banner displays to users:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/f6248d99-fd9f-4265-8bdd-a1afaf697275\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>How users update the browser settings in Teams:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/6a1bfb4c-d8f2-4c01-a409-20d29fe957db\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
