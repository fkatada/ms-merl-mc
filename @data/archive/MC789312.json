We apologize for any inconvenience.\n</p><p>In Microsoft Purview, audit search provides your organization with access to critical audit log event data, allowing you to gain insight and further investigate user activities. The Microsoft Purview Compliance portalâ€™s audit search UI currently includes several search fields (i.e., date range, activities, workloads, users, etc.) to facilitate the retrieval of relevant logs. With a recent update, we have added four additional fields to the audit search UI.</p><p>These four fields are described below:</p>\n\n\n<table>\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>New filter field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Id</th>\n<td>Unique identifier of an audit record.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>UserType</th>\n<td>The type of user that performed the operation. See the UserType table for details on the types of users.</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>UserKey</th>\n<td>Azure Active Directory Object ID in GUID format.</td>\n\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>ClientIP</th>\n<td>The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged.</td>\n\n</tr>\n \n</tbody></table>\n\n<p><br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=384092\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">384092</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Public Preview: We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>Security admins in your organization who use audit in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal will be able to use these four additional fields to retrieve relevant audit logs.  \n</p>\n\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
