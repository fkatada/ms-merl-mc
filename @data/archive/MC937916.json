Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management: Admins will be able to increase the CPU and GPU device resource utilization limit for all devices uploading forensic evidence clips in their organization. After this rollout, forensic evidence will allow up to 31% CPU and GPU device resource utilization (compared to the prior maximum limit of 5%). This enhancement will give admins the option to reduce interruption in the recording and uploading of clips.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=420940\" target=\"_blank\">420940</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-November) and expect to complete by mid-February 2025 (previously mid-November).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In IRM, go to <i>Forensic Evidence</i> to review the new limits:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/28093270-8682-41f0-9f84-e089607b93dc\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>This change will be available by default for admins to configure if desired.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
