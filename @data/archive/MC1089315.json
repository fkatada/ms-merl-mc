Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance security, we are making a critical change to how Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft OneDrive integrate with Microsoft Entra B2B. This change affects how external users access previously shared content.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Effective July 1, 2025, external users will no longer be able to access files, folders, or sites using links that were shared via SharePoint One Time Passcode (OTP) before your organization enabled Microsoft SharePoint and OneDrive integration with Microsoft Entra B2B.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>All users in every tenant that has already enabled or in future, will enable SharePoint integration with Entra B2B are impacted. Your external users will lose access to all the files, folders and sites shared via SharePoint One Time Passcode (OTP) before enabling this integration. To give access again, resharing is required. After the integration is enabled, external sharing will use Microsoft Entra B2B Invitation Manager.
