    "Content": "<p>Updated December 19, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The Loop app now provides a personal workspace to all users, which is shared with Copilot Pages. This personal workspace is a user-owned SharePoint Embedded container, one per user. Governance, lifecycle management and compliance processes are similar to that user's OneDrive. The existing Ideas workspace will begin functioning as a shared Loop workspace because it is not a user-owned container.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=422727\" target=\"_blank\">422727</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=422729\" target=\"_blank\">422729</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 (previously mid-December) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January)</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID 422727: The personal workspace is a user-owned SharePoint Embedded container and follows similar governance, lifecycle management and compliance processes to the user's OneDrive, details about departure and storage can be found <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/loop/loop-workspaces-storage-permission?view=o365-worldwide#loop-workspace-membership-and-microsoft-365-groups\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID 422729: The existing Ideas workspace, while positioned in the product as a personal workspace, uses the shared Loop workspace infrastructure and is not managed with the user account. As a result, with the arrival of the truly personal workspace, the existing Ideas workspace will begin functioning as a shared Loop workspace in the user's experience.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is nothing you need to do to prepare.
