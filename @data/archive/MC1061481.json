    "Content": "We are announcing the Route to least active representatives in messaging channels feature for Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature will enable admins to configure least active assignment strategy on messaging queues to route the work items to the least active service representative. This feature will begin to roll out for general availability on April 22, 2025, and will reach all regions by April 30, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The route to least active representatives in messaging channels assignment method will be available as an out-of-the-box assignment strategy and as an ordering option in custom assignment rules. The setting will first prioritize service representatives with the lower number of active conversations. If all representatives have the same number of active conversations, the representative with the oldest capacity release time is prioritized.<br><br>For Service Representatives working on both voice and messaging queues, a service representative’s least active time will be determined basis their last capacity release time across voice and messaging conversations.<br><br>If you are using Least Active Routing in voice queues, and agents handle both voice and messaging channels, this change will impact the assignment in the existing voice queues using the Least Active Routing assignment method.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
