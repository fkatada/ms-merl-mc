    "Content": "<p><i>This message applies only to new Outlook for Windows and has no impact on classic Outlook for Windows.</i>\n</p><p>This is a reminder for administrators to review the policies your organization has configured to manage new Microsoft Outlook for Windows. The new article <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2305054\" target=\"_blank\">Map classic Outlook policies to new Outlook</a> explains how key policies you may be using to control classic Outlook will map to new Outlook. We encourage admins to read the article and make the necessary policy updates in new Outlook for Windows to achieve their desired behavior.\n</p><p>Administrators should make sure to review the policies available to control whether mailboxes outside of your Microsoft 365 tenant can be connected to new Outlook for Windows. If you want to restrict the kinds of email accounts that can be connected to new Outlook, you should ensure you have configured these policies:\n</p><p>1. Set the policy to require that new Outlook must use a managed device's Windows signed-in account as the primary account.

If you do not set this policy, a user who has not already signed into new Outlook with their work or school account will be able to connect using a personal mailbox (such as Outlook.com, Gmail, IMAP) before signing in with their work or school account. \n</p><p>2.  Set the <code>PersonalAccountsEnabled</code> policy on your organization's mailbox to control whether personal mailboxes can also be connected to new Outlook.

Set the <code>AllowedOrganizationAccountDomains</code> policy on your organization's mailbox to control whether work or school mailboxes on a different SMTP domain can also be connected to new Outlook.

Also, set the <code>OneWinNativeOutlookEnabled</code> policy to <code>false</code>. These two actions will prevent your organization's mailboxes from signing into new Outlook and will also prevent users from selecting any other mailboxes to sign in.
