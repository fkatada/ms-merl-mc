On event start, attendees will be able to view and engage with the embed stream on the published site.  \n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=401120\" target=\"_blank\">401120</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously early October) and expect to complete by mid-November 2024 (previously mid-October).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out early December 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by mid-January 2025 (previously mid-December).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>Users will be able to copy embed code directly from town hall scheduling form on event publish.
