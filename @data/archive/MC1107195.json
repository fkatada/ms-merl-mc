    "Content": "We are announcing the ability to reach your customers through your branded mobile application with our mobile messaging experience in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature will reach general availability on July 31, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThe native software development kits (SDK) are both a native iOS and Android SDK that enable applications to start, manage, and retrieve customer communications for Dynamics 365 Contact Center. Both SDKs contain two main components:<ol>\n    <li>A ready-to-brand, fully featured, messaging user interface that developers can integrate into their existing application. The included interface is based on the live chat widget so brands can use the same features and customizations as their web program.</li>\n    <li>An optional communication layer, containing all the messaging functions necessary to host a conversation that developers can use directly to support a new or existing fully custom messaging interface. Brands that opt to use the included interface don't need to interact with this layer.</li>\n</ol> \n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br>\nIf you would like more information about this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO11220\" target=\"_blank\">Add messaging to native mobile apps</a>.",
