Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Admins will be able to ensure that new Loop workspaces are connected to and managed by an existing Microsoft 365 Group, similar to SharePoint Team sites.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=422725\" target=\"_blank\">422725</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late June 2025 (previously late March) and expect to complete by late July (previously late April).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Once Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=422728\" target=\"_blank\">422728</a> is available, end-users will have the ability to choose existing Microsoft 365 Groups for managing new Loop workspaces. This means that new Loop workspaces can optionally be connected to and managed by an existing Microsoft 365 Group, similar to how SharePoint Team sites are managed.</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID 422725 covers the capability to <b>ensure</b> that new Loop workspaces are connected to and managed by an existing Microsoft 365 Group, similar to SharePoint Team sites (it will not be an option for users to skip selecting an existing Microsoft 365 group if this policy is configured).</p><p>While this setting may align with existing governance processes, it's important for admins to note that scenarios like <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365insiderblog/automatically-aggregate-teams-meeting-content-in-a-loop-workspace/4287319\" target=\"_blank\">automatic aggregation of Teams meeting content into a Loop workspace</a>, or the creation of small, short-term project workspaces, will be more challenging for end-users unless they can skillfully select an existing M365 group during creation. Please consider this tradeoff in your adoption strategy.</p><p>If your organization has governance tools for SharePoint Communication sites that work effectively in a reactive manner (i.e., governance is applied after the site is created), Microsoft recommends extending this process to include Loop workspaces rather than using this policy.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>There is nothing you need to do to prepare. This capability will roll to your tenant automatically.</p>",
