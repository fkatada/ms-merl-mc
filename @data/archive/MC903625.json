Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview compliance portal | Communication Compliance: A notification banner designed to enhance transparency will alert users when keywords embedded in hidden content (such as hyperlinks or encoded strings) trigger a compliance policy match. With this rollout, investigators will be able to quickly recognize that some or all keyword matches are not immediately visible in the main content body, saving time and ensuring a more efficient triage experience.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=417483\" target=\"_blank\">417483</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 (previously early December) and expect to complete by late January 2025 (previously late December).\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early April 2025 (previously early February) and expect to complete by mid-April 2025 (previously early mid-February).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, users and investigators are not notified if policy matches occur for hidden text.\n</p><p>After this rollout, users will be notified if any policy matches in a message are concealed and not readily discernible in the main content.\n</p><p>This feature is available by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
