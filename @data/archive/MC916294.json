Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Improving interop between the new Microsoft Teams client and Skype for business<br></p><p>Currently when making or receiving a call in the new Microsoft Teams client while an existing Skype for Business (SfB) call is ongoing, the call in Skype for Business does not automatically go on hold. The reverse scenario has the same problem.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024.<br></p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024.<br></p><p>General Availability (GCC High):&nbsp; early November 2024 and expect to complete by mid-November 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-November 2024 and expect to complete by early December 2024 (previously late November).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>We have addressed this issue so that when the user is on a call in SfB and answers a call in Microsoft Teams the SfB call will go on hold.  Similarly, if they are on a call in Teams and answer a call in SfB the Teams call will go on hold. The user must be using the new Microsoft Teams client version 24261.1100.3128.2662 or greater.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>Once this feature is available it must be enabled following the steps below.  \n</p><p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul><li>The group policy registry key \"Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Lync\\Enable21Interop\", DWORDis set to \"0x01\"<br></li><li>The group policy registry key \"Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Lync\\EnableIPCForHoldResume\", DWORDis set to \"0x01\"</li></ul>",
