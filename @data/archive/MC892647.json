    "Content": "<p>Updated October 22, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: When users connect their laptop to a room's shared peripheral through USB, Teams will automatically detect the room's audio and recommend the room audio option on the pre-join screen to help streamline a user's entry into a <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-shared-display-mode-in-meeting-rooms-a59c6886-9028-44da-a3cc-5563be40a214\" target=\"_blank\">bring your own device (BYOD) meeting room</a>. If a room's audio peripherals are recognized as shared or they are on Microsoft's known BYOD peripherals list, the room audio option will be suggested to users. After users connect the peripheral to their laptop and join a meeting, users will automatically transition to the room's audio if a room's audio peripherals are recognized as shared <b>and </b>are on Microsoft's known BYOD peripherals list* <b>or</b> if the room's audio peripheral is associated** to a room via the Microsoft Teams Pro management portal. A shared peripheral is one that is being used by multiple users, which distinguishes it from a personal peripheral. This message applies to Teams on Windows desktops and Mac desktops.\n</p><p>*<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-shared-display-mode-in-meeting-rooms-a59c6886-9028-44da-a3cc-5563be40a214\" target=\"_blank\">Use shared display mode in meeting rooms - Microsoft Support</a> (will be updated with a list of known BYOD peripherals before rollout)\n</p><p>**<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bring-your-own-device\" target=\"_blank\">Bring Your Own Device Rooms in Teams Pro Management portal</a> (will be updated before rollout)\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=413710\" target=\"_blank\">413710</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early October 2024 and expect to complete by mid-October 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously late October).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: When users connect their laptop in a BYOD meeting room to a room's shared peripheral through USB, users must decide on their own whether to use the room audio option, and no suggestions are given based on BYOD peripheral connectivity.\n</p><p>After this rollout, users working at home should experience no changes. Users in the office will notice that when starting a meeting with certain room peripherals plugged in, the room audio option on pre-join will be suggested. For other room peripherals, the room audio option will be selected for them.
