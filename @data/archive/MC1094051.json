In future depending on updated timelines, SharePoint Lists or Document Libraries with SPFx Field Customizers may get affected:</p><ul><li>Field Customizers will no longer render custom code.\n</li><li>Column data will display using the default rendering based on column type.\n</li><li>Other SPFx extensions, such as <i>Command Set Customizers</i> and <i>Application Customizers</i>, will continue to function as expected.\n</li></ul><p>We recommend transitioning to <i><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/column-formatting\" target=\"_blank\">Column Formatting</a></i> for visual customizations.
