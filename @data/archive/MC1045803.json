This feature provides the ability to build and configure rules for an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) agent within Power Apps. This feature will reach general availability on April 30, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>This feature lets Power Apps administrators build and adjust IVR agent rules without modifying the agent's logic. It enables quick responses to events like natural disasters, power outages, market changes, or policy updates. Administrators can use Dataverse tables to set dynamic values such as store locations, transfer numbers, broadcast messages, and business lines. These agent rules enhance agility, adapt IVR flow quickly, ensure continuity, and improve customer satisfaction, all while minimizing the need for extensive testing and deployment.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
