    "Content": "<p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: Add a Loop workspace tab to standard channels enabling your team to brainstorm, co-create, collect, and organize content—together in real time. Everyone in the Team will have access to the Loop workspace, even as Team membership changes, and the workspace will adhere to the governance, lifecycle, and compliance standards set by the Microsoft 365 group backing the team. This message applies to Teams on Windows desktop, Teams on Mac desktop, and Teams on the web.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=472022\" target=\"_blank\">472022</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete in late January 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out February 2025 and expect to complete in late February 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout, all users with the Loop app enabled on Teams will receive this experience by default.\n</p><p>To get started, users can select the plus sign (+) at the top of the Teams channel and select <i>Loop </i>from the list.\n</p><p>With this rollout, we will support these features:\n</p><ul><li>Creating a new workspace for a standard Teams channel where the workspace membership is the Channel group membership.\n</li><li>Adding pages, files, and links to the workspace, collaborating with others, and sharing pages as components in Teams chats and channels. Users will be able to complete all their Loop workspace workflows in Teams.\n</li><li>Recreating the Loop workspace tab in the channel, in case someone removes it by mistake.\n</li><li>Deleting the Team will delete the attached Loop workspace. The workspace will be restored if the Microsoft 365 group is restored.\n</li><li>If the user adding the Loop app to a channel does not have the appropriate license or permission to create a workspace, the user will be blocked from adding the app.\n</li><li>The Loop workspace created in a Teams channel will automatically receive the sensitivity label of the Microsoft 365 group at creation time. With this rollout, when the label of a Microsoft 365 group changes after workspace creation, the label will not be automatically propagated to the workspace's Microsoft SharePoint Embedded (SPE) container. Admins can update labels for these workspaces in the SharePoint admin center.\n<ul><li>Coming soon in late February: When the label of the Microsoft 365 group changes, that update will automatically propagate to the SPE container for the workspace within 24 hours. We will update this message when this feature is available.\n</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/cb32aeed-694d-4171-a018-ff6cd5d48c93\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
