This feature will reach general availability on June 6, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nFinancial tags let organizations track user-defined fields on accounting entries posted to the general ledger, eliminating the need to create financial dimensions that contain values that aren't reusable.<br><br>\nThe financial tag values can be used for reporting purposes. For example, you can create a financial tag to track time and expenses related to an initiative without requiring a unique financial dimension.<br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br>\nFor more information on this feature, please review <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/10751\">Use financial tags for project sales orders and journals</a>.
