We have received feedback regarding concerns about the content policy, specifically in relation to personal pages. Starting mid-March 2025 and ending early April 2025, we will retire the ability for SharePoint users to create personal pages from SharePoint s<i>tart </i>(Preview).\n</p><p>The other features in SharePoint <i>start </i>(Preview) will continue to work after we retire the ability to create personal pages from SharePoint <i>start </i>(Preview).\n</p><p>As an alternative, we recommend that SharePoint users create pages that are connected to sites from SharePoint <i>start (Preview).</i>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>When the retirement has been implemented for your tenant, this notification will display at the top of the SharePoint user page: <i>Publish your pages to sites. Creating new personal pages that arenâ€™t connected to sites is no longer supported.</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/4749cc5d-48ae-48b3-8550-f80e49ed3af8\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user message\">\n</p><p><i>To create a new page from a page template in SharePoint </i>start<i> (Preview) that is connected to a SharePoint site</i>\n</p><p>1. In SharePoint <i>start</i> (Preview), go to <i>Create a page</i> and select a page template:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ce4dca91-3b5a-4995-9346-6eddde288f74\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>2. On the right panel, choose a SharePoint site or enter the name of a SharePoint site to begin creating a new page on that site.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/98a6c4ce-f28b-4535-ad3a-50a8a85aa6e1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><i>FAQs</i>\n</p><p><i>Can users still access personal pages they have created before the retirement?\n</i></p><ul><li>Users can continue their work on these pages. They can be found under <i>My pages</i> or <i>My pages on this site </i>in SharePoint <i>start </i>(Preview).\n</li></ul><p><i>Can users move these personal pages to another location?</i>\n</p><ul><li>No, but SharePoint admins can move existing personal pages to other destinations using this PowerShell cmdlet: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/copy-spopersonalsitepage?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Copy-SPOPersonalSitePage (Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell)</a>\n</li></ul><p><i>Can users convert a personal page to a page connected to a SharePoint site?</i>\n</p><ul><li>No, there is currently no option for users to convert personal pages to pages connected to SharePoint sites through the user interface.
