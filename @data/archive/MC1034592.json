Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>In SharePoint Online, Table toolbar is a new toolbar that allows authors to use table functionality. Table Styles was previously available on the text webpart. All the Table Styles styles are now available via the Table toolbar, including some new table features like merge, split, add space before and after, and others. With the introduction of Table toolbar, users see a menu that is always in focus when working on a table. The Table toolbar will automatically adjust by expanding or compressing based on the section layout used. When compressed, the table options move into the overflow (...) button.</p><p>The new table toolbar will be available in SharePoint and Viva Amplify.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We began rolling out mid-April 2025 and expect to complete by mid-May 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Within the text web part, users will be able to insert a table and, once the table is inserted, users will see the Table toolbar that is always in focus.
