With this update, existing Loop components will no longer render interactively in Word web documents. Instead, users will see a read-only placeholder with a link to open the Loop component externally.\n</p><p>This ensures continued access to content without data loss but removes in-document interactivity.\n</p><p>Our reporting indicates that your organization may have users who open Word web documents containing Loop components. No admin action is required, but this change may impact user workflows.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Notify your users about the upcoming change and the new placeholder experience.\n</li><li>Update internal documentation to reflect the change in behavior.\n</li><li>Encourage users to access Loop components via the provided external link if interactivity is needed.\n</li></ul><p><br></p>",
