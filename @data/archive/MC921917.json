    "Content": "<p>In Microsoft Purview, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) analytics is a feature that helps you to analyze data protection challenges, gaps, policy, and posture enhancement possibilities in your organization.<br></p><p>After you turn on DLP analytics, recommendations are generated weekly. There are two new cards that show prioritized recommendations, while <i>View all recommendations</i> shows all generated recommendations.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>DLP analytics provides details on risks, blind spots, and policy improvement opportunities based on the past 30 days' data with one-click recommendations. Also, new recommendations will be available each week.</p><p><u>Turn on Analytics\n</u></p><p>Step 1: </p><p>In Purview, go to <i>Data loss prevention</i> on the left navigation and select <i>Overview.</i></p><p>The task pane shows an option to <i>Turn on analytics</i>. \n</p><p>After turning on analytics, it takes up to 7 days to generate recommendations.

The recommendations are prioritized by highest impact. The top two recommendations are shown as cards and the rest are available as prioritized lists for admins to take necessary actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Step 3: </p><p>View all recommendations and take actions.\n</p><p>Recommendations are generated weekly and will remain in the queue for 4 weeks unless admin actions are taken. \n</p><p>For policy improvement recommendations that require an update to policies, a copy of the policy is created when the admin takes action.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/80a6a8ad-f948-400d-9684-e1f015bbd35d\" style=\"width: 600px;\"><br></p><p><u>Disabling Analytics\n</u></p><p>From the Task pane on the DLP overview page, you can disable analytics in the <i>Manage settings</i> pane.
