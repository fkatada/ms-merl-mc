In fact, most of these endpoints show zero usage.\n</li><li>These endpoints were primarily used in legacy development scenarios and are not required for modern SharePoint development practices.</li><li> If your organization has an internal development team, we recommend consulting with them to confirm whether these endpoints are in use.
