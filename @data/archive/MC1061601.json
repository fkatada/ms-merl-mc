This feature allows users to migrate links and notes attached to records in Business Central when transitioning from on-premises environments to cloud environments. This feature will reach general availability on May 1, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Previously, links and notes attached to records were not automatically migrated during the cloud migration process and users had to manually move that data. This feature introduces cloud migration setup and replication tooling will automatically migrate any links and notes on records during the cloud migration process.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
