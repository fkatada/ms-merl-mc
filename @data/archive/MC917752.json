Two new toggles on the <i>Settings </i>page will allow admins to control the visibility of these features.\n</p><p>By default, both the module and the tab are turned on, making them visible to members. Admins can easily hide them by switching off the corresponding toggles. These changes can be made at any time without affecting existing data, giving admins more flexibility to tailor the community experience based on the relevance of these features.\n</p><p>Before this rollout: The settings did not exist, so community admins did not have the ability to hide or unhide <i>Community Resources</i> and the <i>Files </i>tab in Viva Engage Communities.\n</p><p>The new toggles are off by default.\n</p><p>To access the Community settings page, go to a community page and select Settings from the three-dot menu in the top right:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/7a0cefc1-e316-46a7-8002-5610251d1ab9\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>The <i>Community settings</i> page will have two new toggles to hide/unhide the <i>Community Resources</i> module and the <i>Files </i>tab:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/214ca514-918a-4426-865f-5da30c3c68e0\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
