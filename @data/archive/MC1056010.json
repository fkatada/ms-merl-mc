    "Content": "Starting in June 2025, we are updating the prerequisites for sharing cloud flows. With this update, users must be members of the environment where the flow is located.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br> \nCurrently, a flow can be shared with a user who is not a member of the environment in which the flow resides. If shared as a co-owner, the user can modify and run the flow. Following this upcoming change, users will instead receive an error message indicating they do not have access to the flow. <br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br> \nPlease review your list of shared flows for users who have access to the flow but not the environment it resides and consider providing them with access to the environment.",
