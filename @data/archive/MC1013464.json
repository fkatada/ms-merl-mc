After the EEEU permission is removed, these apps, processes, and users will lose access to the content from the affected OneDrive accounts. Users, processes, and apps that were granted direct permissions to specific files and folders of a OneDrive account will not be impacted and will continue to retain their access.\n</p><p>We recommend OneDrive owners and OneDrive admins give explicit permission to individual files and folders in OneDrive to be accessed by one or more users or apps.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This change will happen automatically by the specified date.
