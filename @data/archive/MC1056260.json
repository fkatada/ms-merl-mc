Continuing to run unsupported software may expose your organization to security vulnerabilities and compliance risks, and may affect the reliability and performance of services.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To mitigate these risks while maintaining access to desktop Office apps, we recommend upgrading devices to a Microsoft 365 or Office 365 suite that includes Microsoft 365 Apps (for enterprise or for business). Microsoft 365 Apps provides always-up-to-date versions of familiar apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for desktop, mobile, and web with continuous support under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/modern-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>, and is eligible for use with the Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on. \n</p><p>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For scenarios that require a fully disconnected solution, we recommend upgrading to <a href=\"https://aka.ms/OfficeLTSC2024-EOSLearn\" target=\"_blank\">Office LTSC 2024</a>. Office LTSC 2024 includes a subset of the value in Microsoft 365 Apps and will be supported until October 2029 under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/fixed-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Fixed Lifecycle Policy</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Take steps to prepare for this transition with the following resources:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Read the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/endofsupport/plan-upgrade-older-versions-office\" target=\"_blank\">upgrade guidance</a> for an overview of how to move from Office 2016 or Office 2019 to Microsoft 365 Apps.&nbsp;</li><li>Consider engaging <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft FastTrack</a>, a Microsoft support service, for moving to Microsoft 365.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Plan ahead to avoid potential disruptions and keep your organizationâ€™s software environment secure and up to date.&nbsp;</p>",
