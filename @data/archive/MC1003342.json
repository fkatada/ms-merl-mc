    "Content": "<p>Before this rollout, users can apply a sensitivity label to a non-Office file or a PDF file in Microsoft Windows to apply protection that encapsulates the file into a .pfile file type that can verify user authorization and rights on the file.  A user who needs to modify and collaborate with others on a .pfile can use Microsoft Purview Information protection (MPIP) to remove the label and protection on the .pfile, make changes, and then reapply the label and protection to the updated file.\n</p><p>After this rollout, Microsoft Purview Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (EDLP) will be able to simplify and protect the collaboration experience in managed Windows devices in conjunction with the MPIP client. Non-Office files and PDF files stored on managed devices will be labeled while retaining their original file types to allow a user to modify and update the file on their device. When a user copies and uploads a labeled file to a destination external to their Windows device, EDLP will help enforce the rights protection by converting the file to a .pfile for secure sharing to other users. If the other users are also protected with EDLP, they can use MPIP to remove the label on the shared files before collaborating.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=476494\" target=\"_blank\">476494</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-March 2025 and expect to complete by mid-April 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 and expect to complete by mid-June 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>There is no change to your organization currentâ€™s use of labels on non-Office files and PDF files.
