Admins can enable or disable Lobby chat with a meeting policy in the TAC. Under <i>Meeting policies &gt; Global (Org-wide default) &gt; Meeting engagement</i>, admins will find a new toggle option for <i>Organizers can chat with lobby participant</i>. When the option is enabled, participants who can't bypass the lobby due to meeting policy will be able to view messages sent by the organizer in a Lobby chat. To enable this policy, <i>Meeting chat </i>in the TAC must be set to <i>On for everyone </i>or <i>On for everyone but anonymous users.</i></p><p><i>Meeting organizer/co-organizer experience: </i>When someone joins the lobby, the meeting organizer/co-organizer will see a new <i>Lobby </i>tab in their Chat experience (meeting chat, one-on-one chat, or group chats). The meeting organizer/co-organizer will be able to send one-way messages to attendees in the lobby in the <i>Lobby </i>tab:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3c3a2952-52c9-4950-8594-ab5d4361b4ca\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><i>Lobby attendee experience: </i>When the meeting organizer/co-organizer sends a message to the lobby, a new <i>Lobby </i>chat panel will open in the right panel of the pre-join screen and display the message.
