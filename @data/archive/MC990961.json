    "Content": "<p>Updated June 5, 2025: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management (IRM) admins will be able to select Data Loss Prevention (DLP) alerts as indicators in IRM policies. After this rollout, IRM admins can select DLP policies that they would like to bring into IRM and detect if a user has alerts for the pre-selected DLP policies. When an IRM alert is generated, admin and analysts can see if there are any high-risk alerts for this user within DLP for the policies that are enabled as indicators. This feature will help admins and analysts view this information in IRM without switching to DLP.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=475057\" target=\"_blank\">475057</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out early March 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously mid-June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Admins will be able to enable this indicator in IRMâ€™s global settings for policy indicators.
