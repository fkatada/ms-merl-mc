    "Content": "<p>As part of Microsoft 365 Copilot for Security in Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Policy Insights helps admins understand DLP policies and its constructs. This enhancement enables DLP admins to gain insights on coverage of policies on pivots like&nbsp;location, classifiers, and notifications.</p><p>DLP admins can get these insights on all the policies or on a few selected policies. They will be able to use prompts to gain a deeper level view of how a policy is configured for their digital landscape. This helps them align their data posture on a regular basis and make corrections to policy posture as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=466740\" target=\"_blank\">466740</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will began rolling out mid-November 2024 and expect to complete by early December 2024.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early January 2025 and expect to complete by late January 2025.\n</p><p>Currently, Copilot for Security is not designed for use by customers using US government clouds, including but not limited to GCC, GCC High, DoD, and Microsoft Azure Government.
