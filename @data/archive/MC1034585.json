These permissions are required for SharePoint Online to function properly.\n</p><p>Tenant admins can remove the permissions (and add them back to the <i>API access</i> page), but these actions could compromise some out-of-the-box functionalities provided by SharePoint.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-March 2025 and expect to complete by mid-March 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late March 2025 and expect to complete by early April 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This change will be on by default and will have no impact on customers.\n</p><p>The <i>API access</i> page is only available if you have provisioned the application catalog for your tenant.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.
