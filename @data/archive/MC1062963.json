This feature automatically saves a copy of flows to browser storage upon a failed save, even if there are errors present. This feature will reach general availability on April 25, 2025.<br><br> \n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThis feature will prevent loss of unsaved solution flow changes during outages when Save Draft or Publish fails, allowing you to save draft or publish later.<br><br>\nFor non-solution flows lacking \"save draft\" functionality, a banner will notify you when a copy is saved to the browser's storage, so this acts as saving an unsaved draft copy of the flow to the browser.<br><br>\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
