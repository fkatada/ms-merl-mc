    "Content": "<p>We will retire the <i>Monitor </i>action in the <i>Safe attachments</i> policy in Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (Microsoft Defender for Office 365) starting late February 2025 and ending by late May 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>A <i>Safe attachments</i> policy provides an additional layer of protection against malicious content (attachments) in emails by analyzing attachment content and behavior in a sandbox environment. This policy provides four actions: <i>Off, Monitor, Block, </i>and <i>Dynamic delivery.</i> We made the <i>Monitor </i>action available for customers who wanted a <i>Safe attachments</i> policy to process attachments, deliver the emails (without blocking malicious attachments), and track what happened with attachments identified as malicious.  Customers used <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#reports-for-your-evaluation-or-trial-of-defender-for-office-365\" target=\"_blank\">reports </a>to see detections from the <i>Monitor </i>action in the policy.\n</p><p>As part of this retirement, if your organization has <i>Safe attachments</i> policies set to the <i>Monitor </i>action, we will automatically change the action in from <i>Monitor </i>to <i>Block.</i> We will not change the policy's recipients, status, or priority. After retirement, the <i>Monitor </i>option will not be available in the Safe Attachments policy page in the Defender security portal or the corresponding Microsoft PowerShell cmdlet.\n</p><p>Before retirement, you can find the <i>Monitor </i>action in Defender &gt; <i>Email &amp; collaboration &gt; Policies &amp; rules &gt; Threat policies &gt; Safe attachments &gt;</i> choose a policy or create a new policy &gt;<i> Edit settings</i> (or <i>Settings </i>if creating a new policy). We will also retire <i>Redirect messages with detected attachments</i>, because this option only supports the Monitor action):\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/5e1bad8a-b171-4d2a-8c35-5d705176f4d3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>After the retirement, the only actions in the Safe attachments policy will be <i>Off, Block, </i>and <i>Dynamic delivery.</i>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Before the retirement, review your <i>Safe attachments</i> policies and take appropriate action if your organization has <i>Safe attachments policies</i> set to the <i>Monitor </i>action. We recommend changing the action from <i>Monitor </i>to <i>Block</i>.\n</p><p>Alternatively, if you still need to run Safe attachment policy in audit mode, we recommend using <a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/atpEvaluation\" target=\"_blank\">Evaluation mode</a>. <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#set-up-an-evaluation-or-trial-in-audit-mode\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about Evaluation mode</a>.\n</p><p>You can also review <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#set-up-an-evaluation-or-trial-in-audit-mode\" target=\"_blank\">detections by Evaluation mode policies</a> using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/try-microsoft-defender-for-office-365?view=o365-worldwide#reports-for-your-evaluation-or-trial-of-defender-for-office-365\" target=\"_blank\">Threat Protection Status report</a>.\n</p><p>Learn more: The <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-about#safe-attachments-policy-settings\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Attachment policy settings</a> section of <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-about#safe-attachments-policy-settings\" target=\"_blank\">Safe Attachments - Microsoft Defender for Office 365 | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",
