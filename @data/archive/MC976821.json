The new usage reports have improved consistency and are more efficient to maintain.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The retirement will not affect existing default reports in the Search and Intelligence portal. There are some differences between the new and old reports, including changes in metrics (such as the new reports have no query count or average position) and improvements to the user experience. For consistency, you cannot switch back to the old reports, and we will not address the disparities of the old reports at this time.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You will have access to view old reports until March 31, 2025. We encourage you to download any necessary old reports by this date for your records. Also, we invite you to explore our new search usage reports available in the <i>Insights</i> tab and provide your feedback using the feedback icon in the Search and Intelligence portal.\n</p><p>Learn more about the new search usage reports: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/usage-reports\" target=\"_blank\">Search Usage Reports | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",
