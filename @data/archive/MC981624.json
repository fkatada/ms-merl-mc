Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are delaying this change until mid-March to allow time to for customer experiencing issues with classic Outlook shortcuts to use this workaround. Some customers may still see classic Outlook shortcuts listed as just \"Outlook\", which could lead to confusion when new Outlook's installed name changes. The workaround for this issue is documented here.</p><p>Coming soon: The installed name for new Microsoft Outlook for Windows will change from \"Outlook (new)\" to \"Outlook.\"\n</p><p>This rollout comes after a change to the classic Outlook in version 2407, previously announced in MC803006 <i>(Update) Outlook for Windows display name change</i> (published June 2024, updated August 2024), which added \"(classic)\" to the installed name to differentiate the two apps.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out late March 2025 (previously mid-March) and expect to complete by early April 2025 (previously late March).\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Outlook in the Windows Start menu. Left: Before the name change. Right: After the name change:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/535f64c3-a82e-4469-9771-1c1020e439eb\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>This change will be on by default. This part of the app identity is not customizable for organizations.\n</p><p>As always, we recommend planning your organization's migration to the new Outlook using the resources at <a href=\"https://aka.ms/newOutlookAdoption\" target=\"_blank\">https://aka.ms/newOutlookAdoption</a><a href=\"https://aka.ms/newOutlookAdoption\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization.
