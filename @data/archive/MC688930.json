Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">The migration to app-centric management using the Migration Wizard (Phase 2) started rolling out in late November 2024 and completed rolling out in mid-December 2024. Administrators are now able to start the migration themselves using the wizard. The automatic migration for customers with only a global permission policy (Phase 1) will complete by end-March 2025 and those with multiple permission policies (Phase 3) will begin in April 2025</p><p style=\"\">Detailed documentation for the migration process is available at <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/app-centric-management\" target=\"_blank\">App centric management to manage user access to Teams apps - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>.</p><p style=\"\">App centric management introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant can install Teams apps. First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to the Teams app store. Second, admins can manage apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization. This feature replaces the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. The app permission policies for existing customers are migrated to maintain existing app availability in the tenant.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=151829\" target=\"_blank\">151829&nbsp;</a> </p><p style=\"\"><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p style=\"\">This feature will gradually roll out across three major phases.</p><p style=\"\">Phase 1:  Auto-migration for only single policy customers - This is applicable for customer with only a global permission policy.
