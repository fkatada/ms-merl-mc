This feature will reach general availability on April 24, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>This feature enables the routing system to adhere to workforce management schedules. <br><br>Key capabilities:<ul><li>Administrators can enable unified routing to support assignment of conversations based on shift bookings created in Dynamics 365 or imported from non-Microsoft workforce management solutions.</li><li>Service representatives will be assigned conversations for the time periods only when they are scheduled for \"working\" type bookings. They won't receive assignments during breaks and training sessions and won't need to manually reset their presence to avoid assignments.</li></ul><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
