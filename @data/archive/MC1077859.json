    "Content": "<p>We are making a change to align with the unified audit model in Microsoft Fabric. As part of this effort, we will deprecate the previously duplicated Audit Event entries emitted by Datamarts, which are already captured by the Fabric Platform. This update ensures that all standard Create/Update/Delete/Read Artifact actions are consistently captured through the Fabric Platform, eliminating redundancy and improving audit clarity.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be retiring this legacy audit event behavior from Datamarts starting June 22, 2025, and completing the retirement by July 7, 2025. Instead, we recommend relying solely on the Fabric Platform audit logs, where we will continue to invest our development resources and enhancements.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You are receiving this message because our reporting indicates your organization may be using the deprecated Datamarts-based audit entries.\n</p><p>After this change is implemented, admins and users will no longer see separate audit entries from Datamarts for standard artifact operations. All auditing for these actions will be unified under the Fabric Platformâ€™s audit model.\n</p><p>If applicable:\n</p><p>We will gradually roll out this change to Targeted Release customers in early June 22, 2025, and expect to complete by early July 2025.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This change will happen automatically by the specified date. No admin action is required.\n</p><p>Please notify your users about this update, review internal documentation, and ensure that any reporting or compliance processes are updated to use the Fabric Platform audit logs.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-auditing\" target=\"_blank\">Track user activities in Power BI - Power BI | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p>",
