After this rollout, users will be able to keep up with their community's activities in real time. We have added additional data ranges to support periods of 7 days, 28 days, 90 days, and 365 days. We have also added a new top conversations table that displays the conversations with the most engagement in the community and new Q&amp;A engagement metrics, including an overview of most popular questions.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=168626\" target=\"_blank\">168626</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-December 2024 and expect to complete by mid-January 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Community analytics had 24-hour refresh periods and limited metrics to 7-day and 28-day periods.\n</p><p>After this rollout: Community analytics will be in real time and include more metrics to help track community engagement over longer time periods. Community analytics are no longer accessed from the <i>About </i>tab.
