    "Content": "We are announcing the ability for administrators to add custom Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models tailored to your organization in Dynamics 365 Contact Center. This feature will reach general availability on June 24, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br> \n\nWith Copilot Studio, administrators can now create custom Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models to predict the intent behind incoming calls and extract critical information. This integration allows developers to upload complex, organization-specific NLU models that ensure the caller's intent is interpreted accurately, reflecting the unique jargon and vocabulary of the business.<br><br> \n\nThe solution enables developers to design a tailored ontology for their domain, defining intents, entities, and the relationships between them by adding annotated data. They can then build training sets with annotated samples based on this ontology and use them to train and test their language models.<br><br> \n\nImporting large volumes of training data is streamlined to minimize training time, accelerating the development process. Custom NLU support is included at no additional cost for customers with a Dynamics 365 license.<br><br> \n\nOnce your Copilot agent is linked to Dynamics 365 Contact Center, you can select Microsoft Custom NLU from the Language Understanding tab under Settings. After selection, you can train your Copilot agent using the data you provide to the custom NLU.<br><br> \n\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br> \nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
