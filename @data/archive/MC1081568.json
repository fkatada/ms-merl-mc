After this feature rolls out, Teams can automatically update users' work location when their laptop connects to their organization's Wi-Fi network or peripherals. The feature can leverage the mapping between your building names and your Wi-Fi networks to set the work location of your users to the right building. It can also leverage mappings to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bookable-desks\" target=\"_blank\">specific peripherals</a>, such as monitors. Teams uses the same policy to enable or disable automatic updates of work location for Wi-Fi and peripherals. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsworklocationdetectionpolicy\" target=\"_blank\">New-CsTeamsWorkLocationDetectionPolicy (MicrosoftTeamsPowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>Teams will not update the location of your users if they connect after their working hours (that they can configure in the Microsoft Outlook Calendar). Also, their work location will be cleared at the end of their working hours.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Automatic update of work location is off by default, but it can greatly improve the experience of your users. We recommend turning it on and configuring it in your tenant.</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with new documentation.</p>",
