This feature will reach general availability on June 6, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The feature will provide administrators with a parameter on the <b>Expense Management Parameters</b> page. When this parameter is enabled, businesses will be able to post expense transactions on a specific posting date instead of the expense report date. This improves general ledger management, ensures sequential voucher numbering, and simplifies statutory compliance, resulting in more accurate financial reports.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
