    "Content": "<p>Updated February 14, 2025: Based on Admin feedback, we are updating the behavior for automated hiding of inactive channels to be opt-in (suggestions) only. With this update, Teams will offer users suggestions on channels that are inactive, and the user is prompted to review their inactive channels and hide them only if they choose. The settings are also updated to reflect this opt-in workflow. There are no changes to the on-demand hiding process.</p><p>This feature is enabled till Targeted Release, and we will roll out to General Availability later this year.</p><p>In the interim, we are disabling the current generally available version of the feature which requires users to opt-out as well as the settings, for all users. Please note that all users in the public or general ring will not see the setting or have any of their channels hidden automatically. We will re-introduce the updated feature later this year.\n</p><p><b>Note:</b> Users with EDU licenses assigned will not receive this change.&nbsp;</p><p><b></b>Microsoft Teams will detect and hide inactive channels users have not interacted with recently. Users can choose to have Teams run this automatically as well as initiate the hiding process on demand when needed. They can review the list of channels and choose none, some or all of the inactive channels to be hidden. Users can opt out of automated hiding anytime from Teams Settings.

This can be done from Settings, under General, by clicking the \"Hide Now\" button. Note that this action can be performed once every 24 hours.</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/7c8c547a-9057-4d11-b42c-9fd485cf89c9\" style=\"width: 500.003px;\"><br></p><p><b>Automated hiding of inactive channels&nbsp;</b></p><p>With this, Teams will hide channels that have been inactive for the user. Inactive channels are identified based on the following criteria: if the user has not been active in the channel in the last 120 days – meaning there is no new messaging in the channel that the user has read or reacted to – the channel is considered inactive. Once the inactive channels are identified, the user is notified with the coach mark message, \"We're hiding some inactive channels for you.\"&nbsp;</p><p>The user can select View changes to see the details. The user can keep the channels hidden or show them again.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/64c7e99d-ba10-4c0f-9672-d5e46ef367dc\" style=\"width: 500.005px;\"></p><p>If a user has less than or equal to 25 shown channels, no channels will be hidden for that user.&nbsp; </p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Admins need to be aware of this feature, but no additional action is needed. The feature will roll out starting in November 2024. Users will first see their settings enabled to manage their preferences for automated hiding; additional to the ability to manually hide inactive channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Users will start to see the automated hiding of inactive channels, a few weeks after the feature has rolled out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
