This update does not “sync” personal files with corporate accounts or vice versa. It simply allows access to separate OneDrive accounts on the same device without merging content – similar to checking both work and personal emails on one device without combining inboxes. Administrators who have already restricted personal accounts on corporate devices can continue to manage this as before.\n</p><p>Importantly, this prompt does not combine or transfer files between personal and corporate accounts. Users must take deliberate action to move or save files between accounts, and Microsoft blocks the move of known folders to personal OneDrive accounts from domain joined devices by default. Additionally, data protection features such as sensitivity labels and data loss prevention (DLP) policies continue to apply.\n</p><p>Devices in regions where the Digital Markets Act is applicable will not see this prompt.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b></p><p>If you don’t want the message prompting users to sign into the OneDrive app with a personal account, you can use policies to disable the prompt.\n</p><p>Organizations that have already disabled personal OneDrive accounts on corporate devices with the <a href=\"https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsharepoint%2Fuse-group-policy%23prevent-users-from-syncing-personal-onedrive-accounts&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cv-rocioclark%40microsoft.com%7C5c756e4f954942746ba408dd9898be59%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638834503998549540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=R%2FruaKTQf4uklhlXfqD3u81yJXd0%2BKu7fvn20WY%2FGdE%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">DisablePersonalSync</a> policy will not see this prompt.
