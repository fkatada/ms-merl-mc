This feature will reach general availability on July 31, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The search functionality will be made available at the upper right of the phone number configuration page. Administrators will no longer need to use the <b>Ctrl+F</b> combination of shortcut keys that previously allowed them to search on the displayed numbers only. Instead, with the search functionality, administrators can search through the entire database of phone numbers enabled for their organization.<br><br><b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
