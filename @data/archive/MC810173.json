    "Content": "<p>Updated October 10, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: New administrative units (AUs) to simplify Teams administration in the Teams admin center. AUs are a way to delegate administration to a subset of users in your organization, based on attributes such as department, location, or business unit along with help of granular role-based access control (RBAC) roles. With the help of AUs, you can create more granular and flexible management scenarios for your Teams environment. This message applies to Teams for Desktop, mobile, and Mac.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=402186\" target=\"_blank\">402186</a>.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early August 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously late September).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Before the rollout: RBAC roles exist, but Teams admins are not able to delegate Teams administration to these roles.</p><p>After the rollout, Global admins will be able to assign the following roles to Administrative Units. These roles can manage only the users and groups assigned to the specific AU:\n</p><ul><li>Teams Administrator\n</li><li>Teams Device Administrator\n</li><li>Teams Communication Administrator\n</li><li>Teams Communication Support Engineer\n</li><li>Teams Communication Support Specialist\n</li><li>Teams Telephony Administrator\n</li></ul><p>Depending on the RBAC role assigned, an admin will be able to manage these administrative areas (from the Teams admin center or Teams PowerShell):\n</p><ul><li>User management: View the user's list page to manage policies, devices, troubleshoot meetings, and allocate direct routing numbers to AU users.\n</li><li>Analytics and reports management: Access reports for users in the AU and manage call quality date on the <i>Call quality</i> dashboard.\n</li><li>Policy management: View the policies list pages and assign policies to any user or groups assigned to the AU.\n</li></ul><p>By default, the AUs are on and accessible to any Teams Global admin. Global admins first need to complete the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage?tabs=ms-powershell\" target=\"_blank\">initial setup of administrative units in the Microsoft Entra portal</a>.\n</p><p>Manage policy assignments from the <i>User details</i> page or the respective policy pages in Teams admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1mUqD?ver=008e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>Troubleshoot meetings in progress and past meetings from the <i>User details</i> page in Teams admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1mUqE?ver=934c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>Review PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) reports for users in an AU in Teams admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1mX1b?ver=76a7\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your Global admins of this new capability and update your training and documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage?tabs=ms-powershell\" target=\"_blank\">Create or delete administrative units - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",
