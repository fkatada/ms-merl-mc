    "Content": "<p>Coming soon: New naming logic for Microsoft OneDrive folder shortcuts. We will add the site name or the user's OneDrive to all new folder shortcuts. Before this rollout, OneDrive shortcuts have the same name as the folder. After this rollout, the shortcut will also include the name of site where there the original folder exists. If a colleague shares a folder with user, and the users creates a shortcut for that folder, the shortcut will include the name of the person who owns the folder. This change will help you easily identify the source of the folder shortcut and differentiate it from other content in your OneDrive &gt; <i>My Files.\n</i></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-March 2025 and expect to complete by mid-April 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout, any new folder shortcuts you add to your OneDrive &gt; <i>My Files</i> will follow the new naming convention.
