On March 24, 2025, we will be retiring the event alerts capability within the Purview Audit solution. With this change, any existing alert policies which had been created through the Audit solution will no longer generate alerts and customers will no longer be able to create new alert policies through the Audit solution. This functionality had already been removed from the Purview Portalâ€™s Audit UI in 2023. Starting March 24, 2025, support for the following cmdlets will also be retired:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/get-auditconfigurationrule?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Get-AuditConfigurationRule</a> \n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/new-auditconfigurationrule?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">New-AuditConfigurationRule</a> \n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/remove-auditconfigurationrule?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Remove-AuditConfigurationRule</a> \n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-auditconfigurationrule?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Set-AuditConfigurationRule&nbsp;</a></li></ul><p>Please note that the <i><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/dlp-alerts-get-started\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">event alerts capability within Purview DLP</a> will remain unaffected</i> by this change.
