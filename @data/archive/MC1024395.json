To resolve these issues and align with the behavior of other M365 apps, whiteboards initiated from the Teams Channel Tab App will now be stored in the corresponding SharePoint site of the Teams Channel (also known as the channel site). This change ensures seamless access for all channel members while adhering to set policies.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out in early April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025.</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>This update will allow whiteboard files to work seamlessly for all channel members, ensuring they continue to adhere to the set policies. All channel members who have access to these whiteboards will be able to discover them from their board picker. No action is required from tenant admins as this change is managed by the Microsoft Whiteboard product team.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>No action is required from tenant admins.</p>",
