Also, we will rename the indicators:\n</p><ul><li><i>Downgrading sensitivity labels applied to SharePoint files </i>will become<i> Downgrading sensitivity labels applied to files\n</i></li><li><i>Removing sensitivity labels from SharePoint files </i>will become<i> Removing sensitivity labels from files\n</i></li></ul><p>In <i>Activity explorer</i>, events that occurred before this rollout for these indicators will continue to show <i>Labels of sensitive files on SharePoint downgraded</i> or <i>Label of sensitive files removed on SharePoint.</i> Events that occur after the rollout will be shown as <i>Labels of sensitive files downgraded </i>or <i>Labels of sensitive files removed.</i>\n</p><p>No action is needed to enable these features. This feature will be on by default. \n</p><p>The renamed indicators in the IRM policy wizard:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/6c64958a-0941-45dc-83c2-3e2bc5a9b16e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n\n</p><p>Example of a new event for <i>Downgrading sensitivity labels applied to files</i> as shown in <i>Activity explorer:</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/7741821e-eb49-4962-9866-29dc65f6f31f\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
