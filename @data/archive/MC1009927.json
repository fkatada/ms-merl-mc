This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed. The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity.\n</p><p>When the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.\n</p><p>This setting update is not needed for newer Bluetooth headsets as the battery life is already optimal.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/65b030c3-88d0-4c81-9b7f-5362f43d716b\" style=\"width: 800px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>This change will be available by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: The section called <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie#get-insight-into-walkie-talkie-usage-and-performance\" target=\"_blank\">Get insight into Walkie Talkie usage and performance</a> in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/walkie-talkie\" target=\"_blank\">Manage the Walkie Talkie app in Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p>",
