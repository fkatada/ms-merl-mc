    "Content": "On January 13, 2025, Power Automate will introduce a new admin tenant setting to control the resubmission of flow runs initiated by instant triggers. This feature will be widely available across all regions by the end of January 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>By default, this feature will disable the ability for users to resubmit flow runs that were initialized using an instant trigger unless the new setting is enabled. If no action is taken, users will be unable to resubmit flows that were previously initialized using an instant trigger.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required. If you want to enable flow run resubmissions for cloud flows that were initialized by instant triggers, admins can follow the steps below:<ol><li>Sign in to your <i>tenant account</i>.<br>PowerShell: Add-PowerAppsAccount -Endpoint \"prod\" -TenantID &lt;Tenant_ID&gt;</li><li>Retrieve and store your tenant settings in <i>TenantSettings</i>.<br>PowerShell: $tenantSettings = Get-TenantSettings</li><li>Set the powerPlatform.powerAutomate.disableFlowRunResubmission flag to False, to allow flow run resubmissions for cloud flows initialized by instant triggers.<br>Powershell: <i>tenantSettings.powerPlatform.powerAutomate.disableFlowRunResubmission= $False<br>Set-TenantSettings -RequestBody $tenantSettings</i></li></ol>If you are not familiar with running PowerShell commands for your tenant, refer to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO9248\"> PowerShell support for Power Automate documentation</a>.",
