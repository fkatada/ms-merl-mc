    "Content": "<p>Updated September 27, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are excited to announce an important update designed to enhance the privacy and security of your organization. Before this rollout, admins had the capability to download voice and face data for their users who have opted in to enroll their voice and/or face on the <i>Recognition</i> tab in Microsoft Teams. With this rollout, to better protect user data, we are shifting this capability to users. This change will ensure that users have more control over their own voice and face data, aligning with our commitment to privacy and security. This change reduces the risk of unauthorized access or sharing, as users will handle their own data export requests and admins will not have access to this data. This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop and Teams for Mac desktop.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=413709\" target=\"_blank\">413709</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-November 2024 and expect to complete by late November 2024.</p><p>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out early December 2024 (previously mid-October) and expect to complete by mid-December 2024 (previously late October).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With this rollout, we will remove the download button from the Teams admin center (TAC) &gt;<i> User &gt; Manage user</i> &gt; select any user &gt; <i>Account:</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oZTc?ver=5a7c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>Users can go to Teams <i>&gt; Settings &gt; Recognition</i> and select the <i>Export</i> button to access their data and download it to their Download folder:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oXm0?ver=9965\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p></p><p>The new Export feature is on by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
