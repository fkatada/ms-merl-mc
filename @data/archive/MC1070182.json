    "Content": "<p>Coming soon for Microsoft Teams: Organizations that do not currently use Teams will be able to join and present in Teams town halls using their own video conferencing devices. Because we have incorporated Cloud Video Interop (CVI) capabilities into the event form, organizers can receive join codes for their tenant and share the codes to presenters, allowing them to easily join the event. This rollout ensures that all presenters can join the green room and can see and hear each other without any limitations. Only trusted CVI devices can join the session. After they join, a meeting organizer or co-organizer can promote the device from attendee to presenter, and then they can communicate with other presenters in the green room before the event starts.\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows desktop, Teams for Mac desktop, and Teams for the web.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early May 2025 and expect to complete by mid-May 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 and expect to complete by late May 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This change will be available by default to your organization.\n</p><p>On the event form, the CVI coordinates will appear in the section called <i>Join on a video conferencing device:</i></p><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/9caa1348-52ac-4afa-be7f-07b9182c788d\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before or after the rollout.
