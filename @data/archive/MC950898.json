With the addition of loop component forwarding, users have a new way to share loop components across chats and channels. To forward a message containing a loop component, simply navigate to the <i>more actions</i> menu of any message containing a loop component and select <i>forward</i>. From there, the <i>forward this message</i> dialog will populate, which provides users with a preview of the message being forwarded, including the loop component. In this view, users will be able to give permissions to recipients of the loop component to ensure all recipients have access to the content.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1rpHQ?ver=5576\" style=\"width: 500px;\"><br></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1rxvF?ver=c5bd\" style=\"width: 500px;\"><br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=469507\" target=\"_blank\">469507</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release:&nbsp;We will begin rolling out in early January 2025 and expect to complete by mid-January 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out in late January 2025 and expect to complete by early February 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>\n</p><p>Users will now have less restrictions when forwarding content.
