    "Content": "<p>Updated February 11, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In new Outlook for Windows and web, when single-clicking on an empty time slot on the calendar surface, the quick compose pop-up will no longer appear. Instead, you will be able to create an appointment by typing directly in the time slot on the calendar grid, just as you can in classic Outlook for Windows. There will be no change to double-click behavior; the full compose form will still open as it does today.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=406948\" target=\"_blank\">406948</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early March 2025 (previously early February) and expect to complete by late March 2025 (previously late February).\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late March 2025 (previously late February) and expect to complete by late April 2025 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This may affect how users create appointments quickly on the calendar surface. We expect this to be a better experience, especially for those familiar with classic Outlook inline appointment creation.\n</p><p>This update is available by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p>",
