Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Before this rollout, users with a Microsoft 365 license can use the <i>Planner </i>tab in Microsoft Teams to create and add existing basic plans and lists to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/standard-private-or-shared-channels-in-microsoft-teams-de3e20b0-7494-439c-b7e5-75899ebe6a0e\" target=\"_blank\">standard channels</a> in Teams.
