This feature will reach general availability on May 19, 2025.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The plan designer will suggest a set of solutions to solve your business problem based on the needs of your organization. The set of solutions that are suggested may already exist in your environment. Instead of creating a new app, you can now replace a suggestion with an existing app or add an existing app to the set of solutions directly in the plan designer.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
