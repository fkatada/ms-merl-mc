Before rollout, we will update this post with new and revised documentation.\n</p><p><b>Data availability</b>: Uploaded data will be available to leaders and their delegates, so don’t upload sensitive Human Resources (HR) attributes that you would not want to be accessible to leaders and delegates. Questions regarding HR data will be answered based on all users who have a Viva Insights license. </p><p><b>Review general manager and delegate roles:</b> This update will be rolled out to anyone with a general manager (GM) role who meets minimum team size, or anyone who has delegate access from a leader. If you do not want a user to have access to Copilot in Viva Insights, you can remove their GM role. If you do not want a delegate to have access, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/office-docs-powershell/blob/Viva-chrisda/exchange/exchange-ps/exchange/Remove-VivaOrgInsightsDelegatedRole.md\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">remove their delegate access with a Microsoft PowerShell script</a>.</p>",
