Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: Microsoft Teams will be bringing Workflows powered by Microsoft Power Automate to the three-dot menu for files shared in Teams chat or channels.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381643\" target=\"_blank\">381643</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out late October 2024 (previously mid-October) and expect to complete by early November 2024 (previously late October).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously early November).\n</p><p>GCC: We will begin rolling out early December 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by mid-January 2025 (previously mid-December).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>To make sure Microsoft Teams provides the best workflow experience for our users, we are making it easier to configure and run workflows for files. A user will be able to select the three-dot menu on files shared in Teams chat or channels, and then choose <i>Workflows</i>. From <i>Workflows</i>, the user will choose an instant workflow to run on a file. The user must set up the workflows in advance. A user can set up a new workflow for files by selecting <i>See more workflows </i>at the bottom of the three-dot menu. This launches the Workflows task module, where a user can choose a template to start setting up a new workflow. Examples of file workflows include Request approval for selected file, Get notified in Teams when a file is updated, Create a PDF copy of the file, and Add a task for this file.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1jVFL?ver=c127\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>If the Power Automate app is disabled in the Teams admin center, users will not see this option in the three-dot menu.\n</p><p>This feature will only be available in the New Teams client on the desktop and on the web.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action is needed from you to prepare for this rollout. You may want to notify your users about this change so they can find the new entry point for Workflows.</p>",
