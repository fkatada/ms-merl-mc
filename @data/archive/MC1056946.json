This feature grants administrators the ability to create templates for common routing rules, which can then be applied to queues and workstreams. This feature will reach general availability on April 18, 2025.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThis feature allows the creation of templated rulesets for routing configurations such as prioritization, assignment, and work classification. Apply these templates directly when setting up rulesets in a queue or workstream. Administrators can manage and publish updates to these templates globally, ensuring consistent rules across all queues and workstreams. <br><br>\n <b>What action do I need to take? </b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required. <br><br>\nIf you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/10189\">Manage template rulesets</a>.",
