Many sports leagues and teams offer calendar subscriptions that users can import into Outlook. <b>NOTE: </b>Users must set up this alternative in Outlook for the web or new Outlook for Windows desktop. When a user adds a sports calendar with <i>Subscribe from the web,</i> the sports calendar will sync to calendars in Outlook for Mac desktop and Outlook for iOS/Android. Here is the process:</p><p>1. In Outlook, go to the Calendar.\n</p><p>2. Select <i>Add calendar</i> from the left side of the screen.</p><p>3. Select<i> Subscribe from web.</i></p><p>4.
