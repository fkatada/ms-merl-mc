    "Content": "<p>Updated March 25, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>After further review, we are not able to proceed with these clouds: GCC High and DoD. We apologize for any inconvenience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Outlook: Users can move emails between their accounts in the new Outlook for Windows, streamlining organization and productivity. For enterprise users, this feature is controlled by the Set-OWAMailboxPolicy policy managed by admins in Microsoft Exchange PowerShell. By enabling this policy, admins can grant their users the ability to move emails between accounts in a way that aligns with organizational needs and policies. With this rollout, we are introducing a new parameter called <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-owamailboxpolicy?view=exchange-ps#-itemstootheraccountsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">-ItemsToOtherAccountsEnabled</a> for the Set-OWAMailboxPolicy policy.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=470018\" target=\"_blank\">470018</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by early March 2025 (previously late February).\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 and expect to complete by mid-May 2025.</p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 and expect to complete by  late June 2025.</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):  We will begin rolling out late May 2025 and expect to complete by  late June 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The new parameter <code>-ItemsToOtherAccountsEnabled</code> controls whether users can move or copy their emails between accounts. By default, the value will be <code>False</code>, which means that the policy is disabled and users won't be able to move emails between accounts unless an admin changes the policy to <code>True</code>.\n</p><p>If you enable this parameter, users will be able to move emails between accounts in these ways:\n</p><p>1. Dragging and dropping an email from one account to another\n</p><p>2. Using shortcuts:\n</p><ul><li>Copy: Ctrl C + Ctrl V\n</li><li>Copy: Ctrl + Drag and drop\n</li><li>Move: Drag and drop\n</li><li>Move: Ctrl X + Ctrl V\n</li></ul><p>3. Right-click an email and select <i>Move </i>or <i>Copy</i> from the menu (menu items only available if the policy is enabled)\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/set-owamailboxpolicy?view=exchange-ps#-itemstootheraccountsenabled\" target=\"_blank\">Set-OwaMailboxPolicy (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>#newoutlookforwindows</p>",
