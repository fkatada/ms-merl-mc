This feature will make it easy to find and show a rich embedded adaptive card to recipients. Typing the '/' key followed by the name of the record automatically completes a CRM record name and adds it to the email. This feature will reach general availability on January 20, 2025.<br><br> \n\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br> \nWhile turned off by default, sharing records can be turned on within the Copilot for Sales settings in Outlook, Teams, or other Microsoft 365 applications.<br><br> \n \n\nYou will be able to leverage the existing Outlook '/' support to show a dialog box with recently used Copilot for Sales CRM records. As you interact with Copilot for Sales, those records will be added to the available list to be shown within Outlook emails. Once selected, a rich adaptive card will show the CRM record information.<br><br> \n\n \nRecipients of the adaptive card will only see details if they have CRM access to the CRM record. The adaptive card will auto-refresh to show any changed CRM content, preventing the card from showing stale data.<br><br> \n \n\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br> \nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
