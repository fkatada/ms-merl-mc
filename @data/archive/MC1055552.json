This rollout aims to reduce complexity and prevent conflicting states for those controls, to help provide a smoother experience for admins and users. This rollout will help prevent issues such as Copilot requiring a transcript when Transcript is Off, resulting in error messages for users that cannot be resolved.</p><p>\n</p><p>The feature described in this message is available to all admins in the TAC, but error messages only occur for Teams users who also have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We <span style=\"background-color: rgb(231, 214, 222);\">began </span>rolling out early April 2025 and expect to complete by late May 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p><i>What is changing?\n</i></p><p>Before this rollout, when <span style=\"background-color: rgb(231, 214, 222);\">an admin selects </span>an invalid combination in the <span style=\"background-color: rgb(231, 214, 222);\">TAC</span>, such as Copilot requiring a transcript when <i>Transcript </i>is <i>Off</i>, meeting users with a Copilot license experience an error message in the Copilot right pane that they&nbsp;canâ€™t recover from, <span style=\"background-color: rgb(231, 214, 222);\">because </span>the transcript is not available for them.
