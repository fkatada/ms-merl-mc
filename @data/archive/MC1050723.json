To help address this concern, we will change the user sign-in experience to help reduce the potential for duplicate request errors and show a user how to refresh their notifications in the Authenticator app and Microsoft Authenticator Lite (Microsoft Outlook).\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late March 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025 (previously mid-April).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout, the new user sign-in experience will include the message, “Didn’t receive a sign-in request? Swipe down to refresh the content in your app.” This message tells users they can refresh notifications in the Authenticator app or the Outlook app for iOS/Android if they have not received an expected sign-in notification:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/3d9047b2-9112-44c6-ac79-08b41ba36e03\" alt=\"user controls\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n</p><p>This change will be available by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.
