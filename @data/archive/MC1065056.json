Users who have full access mailboxes that are automapped will see a 'Promote' button on the Shared with Me Settings page. Clicking this button will allow users to add the mailbox as an account.</p><p>For organizations that do not have automapping enabled, shared mailboxes will be automatically added as accounts when the users adds the mailbox and they have the correct permission to add it as an account.&nbsp;</p><p>Once a user adds a shared mailbox as an account, they will have the ability to manage all settings for that mailbox. This is similar behavior that exists in the classic Outlook for Windows and OWA through the 'open another mailbox' button.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information on how to add a shared mailbox as an account in the new Outlook follow this page: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/preview-manage-shared-mailbox-settings-in-new-outlook-f6929a97-4fc6-4a52-b77d-5e596c6322b4?preview=true\" target=\"_blank\">Manage shared mailbox settings in new Outlook</a></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.
