    "Content": "We are introducing AI-powered natural language scripting for Power Automate, which simplifies the process of generating code. This feature will be accessible to users starting January 31, 2025.<br><br> \n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThis feature enables users to articulate their desired scripts in natural language, with AI subsequently generating the corresponding code automatically. This functionality streamlines automation workflows and minimizes the time and effort involved in coding for routine tasks, such as executing PowerShell, VB, CMD scripts, or running SQL statements. This capability is available for the following actions:<ul>\n<li>Run PowerShell</li>\n<li>Run VBScript</li>\n<li>Run DOS command</li>\n<li>Run Python</li>\n<li>Run JavaScript</li></ul>\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.
