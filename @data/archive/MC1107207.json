This feature will reach general availability on July 31, 2025.<br><br>\n \n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nThe enhancements of disposition codes help customer service representatives save time and resources in indicating how calls end. Customer service representatives can choose from a predetermined list while supervisors can view these codes in the closed conversation summary form to aggregate data on how calls are going for their representatives.<br><br>\n \nCustomer service representatives will have the ability to choose a category that will filter the available disposition codes. If the administrator has enabled a maximum number of disposition codes allowed, customer service representatives will see the number displayed in the disposition code area.<br><br>\n \n<b>What action do I need to take?</b> <br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required.",
