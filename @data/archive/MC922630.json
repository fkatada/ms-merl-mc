When tenants disable <code>EnableHoldTheFile</code>, users may have to manage hundreds of conflicts because OneDrive automatically copies a file instead of allowing users to choose to merge conflicts.\n</p><p>After this rollout, the <code>EnableHoldTheFile</code> group policy will be removed and the experience associated with the <code>EnableHoldTheFile</code> group policy will be enabled for all tenants. If a user opens a Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint file and there is a conflict that requires user input to resolve, the user will be given the option to choose the file variation to keep. If the conflict cannot be resolved, a banner will display to either <i>Save a Copy</i> of the file or <i>Discard Changes</i> if the user doesn't care about the changes that were made.</p><p>User notification to choose the file variation to keep in PowerPoint:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/d89770ef-cd05-4488-8fb2-16b07819ff7f\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user notification\">\n</p><p>User notification to <i>Save a Copy </i>or <i>Discard Changes</i> in PowerPoint:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/f96f50cb-5046-4820-8d83-afba0508c23c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user notification\">\n</p><p>User notification to <i>Save a Copy</i> or <i>Discard Changes i</i>n Word:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/198badfd-326c-4323-8996-d7eac3c92ee0\" alt=\"user notification\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
