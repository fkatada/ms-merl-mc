This feature will reach general availability in September 2025. A follow-up message will be published at that time to confirm availability.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>This capability will enable users to:<ul><li>Manually edit the transaction date for per diem expenses.</li><li>Manually update the exchange rate to be used for currency conversion.</li></ul>The modified information will be utilized in subsequent expense-related calculations and postings.<br><br>Currently, the expense management system does not allow for editing transaction dates and exchange rates.
